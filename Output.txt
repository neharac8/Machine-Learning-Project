Completely worth it I bought these earrings as a gift for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved them! They got to my house in a timely manner and they were in pristine condition. I am normally cautious about using any online shopping site but using yours was quite quick efficient and gratifying. Thank you!

Poor quality and Customer Service- buyer beware Received this as a gift from my husband. He had it gift wrapped and held it for the occasion. When I opned the bracelet we were both very disappointed. The quality was very poor and bracelet did hand nicely on the wrist. He contacted the seller through Amazon to request a refund. They refused to refund or exchange the item. Unfortunately he had not opened the item when it was received since it was gift wrapped. He held it beyond their return window as he was saving it to be gifted. I called the vendor myself to explain and seek a compromise. They were unyeilding explaining that they could not return the bracelet to their vendor or restock it so we were out of luck. Beware of the return policy with this vendor especially if it is a gift.

 Ring arrived as described - love it I love amethyst and this ring was exactly as described/pictured. I wear it often. I feel this ring needs to be cleaned on a regular basis because it tarnishes but I clean all my silver jewelry on a regular basis for the same reason. I put this ring on my Amazon Wish List and received it as a gift. I really like it! It fits because I know my ring size so make sure you know your size before ordering. This company has an excellent return policy so if you get your size wrong you can always exchange it for the right size with minimal hassle. Great customer service. I've bought from this company before and always had a good experience.

 Versatile Bracelet I picked out this bracelet for my 25th anniversary. I wanted something with diamonds although these are pretty small. I like that it looks good with both casual and more formal outfits. I would have preferred if it were a little longer. Also I've had to repair the clasp which didn't seem to be too strong. It was bent out of shape. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the product for the money.

 Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Hoop Earrings Bought these recently when Amazon was running a special of $15.00 off on the price and free shipping...So I only paid $14.99 for these earrings. When I received them I was taken by how pretty they were but couldn't figure out if they were white stones or blue! The blue topaz in these earrings was so light that they looked almost like white stones. In that I was disappointed but in everything else very pleased. A value at $14.99 but I would not have paid $29.99 for these earrings with the poor stone color. Problem is

 Too Thick to Wear! This was a case of you get what you pay for! The price was excellent but the stones are barely a blue color at all - not very pretty. Additionally I am not able to wear them because the metal prong that is supposed to go through your ear is so thick (I don't wear earrings all the time so the holes in my ears are not stretched out at all!) I was unable to get it through my ears!

 How did this get so many + reviews?! I really am confused in why this item got so many positive reviews?! Perhaps I just got a dud?! Blue topaz is my birhtstone and seeing the size of these I thought these would be the perfect kind of earrings to put in and forget about....Mind you I own many blue topaz pieces...but these were barely blue at all! And the silver pieces in between the stones? Well it just blended the stones in even more to a washed out faded look! Seriously I couldnt even tell these were blue topaz.Unfortunately

 Everyday great value earrings! I love this earring! The blue topaz is a lighter shade of blue but it's pale with no cloudiness so it is very sparkly. The hoop size is very comfortable and the unique post/hinge/clasp is great (no backings to lose!). I have to say it's great for that everyday goes with everything wearability. For the low price you can't go wrong. (And even better if it's on special!!)

 Beware - Stones are very light blue = almost white in color I bought these as a gift and as someone else mentioned they are not very blue at all. They almost look white. However they are still beautiful earrings. She loved them! The clasp is a little strange. It took me a minute to figure out how to open them. It is not a traditional clasp for earrings. This may bother some people. I don't think I would like it but my gift recipient didn't seem to mind.

 Simple and neat genuine looking So i wanted a simple CZ band which won't scream fake. This does the job- the CZ are recessed properly into the ring and gives that genuine look to it. they stones are not very dazzling or large so for me that was good and believable as diamonds. the ring is not very bright which was a little disappointing because although i didn't want a dazzling ring this is a bit on the dull side akin to when a ring has some age. would work perfectly as a replacement band.***update***So after about 2 months of wearing this band i needed to upgrade my review from 3 stars to 4. The ring actually reflects a little brighter than i first thought so its not dull at all. its a lovely ring!

 I use this daily and it's great! I don't really like wearing my wedding/engagement rings on a daily basis. I'm always doing something with my hands at the gym etc that the rings make me feel uncomfortable and I needlessly worry about whether the diamonds would drop off or I'd lose them.I bought this ring off Amazon.com as it was a cheap version of what my wedding band looked like. I have used this for the past 1 year and trust me it's been through a lot. It still looks great! It's comfortable no maintenance low stress negligible investment and it looks great. No one knows it's not my real wedding band!It really does serve my purpose. I would recommend this ring to anyone who would like something affordable for everyday use but doesn't come off like it came out of a 3rd grader's jewelry box. Quality product.

 Sterling Silver eternity band It's a nice sparkly CZ band nothing extreme the stones are nicely recessed and do not stick out. I bought it as a cheap alternative to keep my gold wedding ring attached to my engagement ring.

 It's a great substitute My wife is pregnant and couldn't wear her wedding band anymore so I had gotten this as a part of her birthday gift. She definitely loved it and totes it around the office mostly because she can wear a wedding band again not to mention that the ring is very pretty. I would definitely recommend this product as a financially sound temporary replacement.

 Love this ring! Doubles as my everyday wedding band! I've been looking for an alternative "everyday" wedding ring to wear. I really wanted an eternity band that had stones all the way around so I wouldn't have to worry about always turning it so that the stones would face outward. Well it turns out that full eternity bands don't really exist anymore and if they do you are going to pay an arm and a leg for it. I have two half-eternity bands at home (real metals/real diamonds) but the "half" eternity part bugged me to no end. So

 Decent but not just right. I actually bought two of these rings to flank another ring and they were the perfect size to do with. The only issue I have is that the photo shows more metal than you actually see in person. Otherwise they were exactly what I wanted. Great buy. Great price. Adequate photo representation.(They also have lasted through a lot more wear and tear than any ring should be put through.)

 Solid but not jaw dropping. I've worn this ring out maybe 10-20 times and have not had any problems with tarnishing or discolorations even after many handwashings per day. It's quite shiny (both the CZ and the silver) my only knock is that the prongs holding the crystals down have such a large surface area compared to the stones detracting from the sparkliness of the CZ. (I bought this to replace a channel-set eternity band which did not have that problem.)I was a little concerned that pointy end of the stones would poke my finger through the holes on the inside but I can't feel them. I don't understand why there are holes at all.

 Fabulous This little ring is worn regularly and has fared well. No stones have fallen out it's kept it's sparkle with little cleaning and my mom's friend who is a jeweler commented on how well made this ring is when taking a quick look at it. I write this review about a year (or more) after having bought this item so highly recommend it.The only thing that prevented me buying another one and from giving it 5 stars is that I am very put off by the stamp inside the ring that reads ...

 BEAUTIFUL!!! This ring is beautiful. Ive never really bought a ring off line so I was a little worried with what I would get. I am a Dental Assistant and I am constantly putting on and taking off gloves as well as washing my hands. I didn't want to take the chance of messing up my engagement and wedding rings. I wanted a band that I could wear every day at work and not worry about messing it up. I finally decided to get a band after wearing my wedding rings at work for 3 years. The ring sparkles and looks great. I also got the ring a day before it said I would.

 Perfect I just received my band and it is exactly what I wanted. I have small fingers and the karat weight is just right and it has sparkle similar to my real eternity band. I am a nurse and worry about my real diamonds so this is the perfect substitute...no one will know the difference. It would be a great stackable as well and wish I had ordered a second which I still may do. Great first jewelry experience with Amazon. What a bargain too!

 So pretty! Very pretty dainty ring. Comfortable. I really love the fact that it's sterling silver. I don't know why ring manufacturers use rhodium plated standard silver instead of sterling. It looks much more like 14K white gold and also the weight is more like 14K. The ring is the right size and very thin and light which I love. My real ring scratches my fingers and gets caught in my hair! This is an improvement.

Also the ring is really comfortable to wear. I own different eternity bands and sometimes they're itchy or uncomfortable but that's not a problem with this one.

 Beautiful ring and a great alternative to the real thing I have a gemological certification and have spent a number of years in the high end jewelry industry. I was looking for an eternity band to wear while traveling afraid to wear my own diamond eternity band abroad. This affordable sterling and cubic zirconia eternity band is far more realistic and beautiful than I had anticipated. If you're looking for an affordable eternity band whether it is to replace your own for travel/security reasons or if you are looking for an eternity band unable to afford real diamonds set in white gold or platinum for yourself or the one you love

 Almost lost it Well charms certainly have changed. No time to reorder something else I gave this as a give but it embarrassed me to do so. Sooooooooo tiny it almost went out with the wrapping. No room to engrave even a year on it. Purchased in White Gold the price was not cheap but I'm sure the gift came across as a gum machine trinket. Too Bad . . .

 Pretty Earrings Nicely Made I really like these earrings. For such a small item there's a lot of detail on the mane and tail. The width of the earrings is 7/8 inch. The height is 3/4 inch. If they were a full circle they'd be about as big as a quarter. They look delicate but they're sturdy. The ones I received look just like the online picture. If you're a horse lover you will really like these.

 Absolutely Beautiful! I was extremely pleased when I received this. It was wrapped and protected for shipping so well I had a hard time unwrapping it. It arrived in excellent condition with no damages. I did read in one review before purchasing that the bottom 4 drawers are actually 2 deep drawers. I wish they were 4 drawers instead but I am still very happy with it. It is a heavy sturdy beautiful piece of furniture and matches nicely with my bedroom set and I would highly recommend this one. It was well worth the money and again beautiful

 Great-looking studs This pair of studs is very sleek & elegant. The amethyst is a sparkling rich purple & surrounded with swirling silver which adds to its contrast.

 Great earrings for the price I actually ordered these for a Halloween costume but they're really pretty. They're a little more delicate than I thought from looking at the picture but with normal wear I don't see that being a problem. Overall I was really impressed. The only thing I didn't like were the french ear wires... they made my ears itchy so they're probably a low grade stainless wire. Not a problem if you don't plan on wearing them all the time.

 Large and plastic These earings are great for the price but I was not expecting anything this clunky and the picture does not convey how plastic looking and feeling the orange "stones" are- there's a ridge around the outside edge from what I assume is the mould. They're also fairly big earings as long as my thumb. I wish Nvie would show pictures of their jewelery on models so the relative size was more apparent.On the other hand once I took the section with the orange and black plastic pieces off the little red bits wrapped in wire made very cute earings on their own!

 Long earrings very attractive elongates the face. These earrings are long the beads are larger than the picture makes them look but that is actually a good thing in my opinion. They are more in proportion to my larger frame that way. I didn't think they looked too plastic and I doubt anyone is going to get all up in my face and judge me for wearing plastic-looking earrings.

 tiny. difficult to adjust. painful to wear I got a lackluster and marginally impersonal response from this company when I wrote in and asked them if they'd accidentally sent me a child-size toe ring. I'd never received one so tiny before or had this issue at all via amazon let alone brick & mortar jewelry stores. It is a pain to adjust and will slip off adjusting it to the size of my other toe rings when they're not extended whatsoever. That was my cue that I wasn't imagining the discrepancy lol it's painful to keep on when adjusted to the point that it won't slip off. Save your $ unless you're buying it for a toddler. If you extend it so it fits your smallest normal-sized adult toe it will fall off. If you tighten it enough so that it will stay on you can't walk.

 It broke after a week! I had originally written a review about this ring after I received it. It was a good review because I was happy at the time. HOWEVER I just had to edit my review because I have only had this ring exactly a week and one of the longest arms or w/e it is broke off!! And dont be fooled the stone in the middle is not like that it is a very small stone in a cone type thing and also it was a little hard to adjust the first time. I will not be purchasing anything else from this company. The only reason it is 2 stars is because I DID like the ring at first.

 Beautiful ring I absolutely love this ring. It's medium size (width) is complimentary finger sizes larger than 6 and 7 which I have a hard time finding. The intricate details and marcasite style make it look much more expensive than its actual price. It goes well with casual and formal attire- great ring for any occasion!

 Unhappy! This ring looks great online but once I received it I was disappointed. Maybe it's because I only got one but I was not happy with it and I must say I will be returning this item. It looks so much better online than what it did when I got it. In my opinion even if I would of bought more than one its not worth the $ that they are asking for. This seller does have a very nice presentation when u receive your package and you will recieve your purchase within the promised time frame.

 Love! I used to not be able to wear rings because I was allergic to the nickle but I found sterling silver to be just fine. Me being the person that never really enjoyed jewelry very much. This ring is so much better when looking at it on your finger than online!! Although it's very pretty online It's not to big and it's modern! The blue is absolutely georgous and the design is great. I love it so very much I don't think I'll ever take it off.

 Unique design Some will love this pendant and some will not. I like it okay. The design while being interesting and unique and the sort of pose that is quite appealing is not fulfilled in the quality of work. The mountain lion for example is not carved as well as it might be. So while this piece is interesting and appealing it is not stunning.

 The packaging was nicer than the product. When I ordered this locket I expected to receive a beautiful antique-looking locket that looked the same in the picture as it did in my hand. I was extremely disappointed. The locket itself is made of cheap thin metal. The "antique" effect is just black paint in the creases. It appears as if the locket was dipped in motor oil but not thoroughly cleaned. The chain is almost as bad. It is very bulky

 not good I have had my nose pierced for years and I am pretty used to purchasing nose pins/rings like this but I have never been so dissapointed. Had I known that the quality of this piece of jewelry was going to be so low I would've saved my $10.99+expedited shipping spend a little more and got a real nose pin. The last nose pin I had got old and was due for a replacement I found this one and bought it but as soon as I got it I thought this must be a joke because it was by far the smallest nose ring I've seen (it wouldn't fit my sister who has a small nose).I have never been dissapointed by bodycandy before so don't let this review reflect your opinion of their company or service. I always receive my orders quickly and I have never been dissapointed with their jewelry before but this piece was laughable.

 Best nose ring I bought this  knowing that the hook would be tight so after several attempts I decide it to bend it with a pair of tweezers. It worked perfect. It's been in my nose ever since. The loop is tight but workable. Ilove it because of the size is perfect. If your looking for something small this is the one.

 Disappointment! Pugster- Unacceptable Customer Service! The 3 charms I ordered from Pugster could be described in a word disappointing. The items were not as they appeared. They were much smaller the graphics very poor.When I attempted to send the charms back I was directed to a very time and energy intensive process to return the charms. At one point in the return process I did not receive return emails or phone calls after 4 attempts to contact Pugster?Needless to say I will not be ordering from Pugster in the near or distant future.

 Pretty! Really pretty ring--beautiful color. Mine did arrive with a tiny chip on the corner of the stone....was pretty inexpensive though so I don't think I'll bother sending it back. One con is that the two exposed points of the stone are rather sharp...you could really hurt yourself/someone is you accidentally scratched them. Overall I am quite pleased with my purchase--4 stars.EDIT

 pretty ring I've just received this ring in the mail this week and it is more lovely in person than the photos. There were no chips on the two exposed edges of the stone but they are very crisp and sharp so I've be mindful when wearing this. I thought that the stone at 2.0 carats would be too large but it looks smaller in person towards the 1 carat range because of the cut of the stone. No matter as this is my favorite cut for stones and doesn't look too small on my large hands. I bought this a sized 9 as I wear either 8.5 to 9 and 9 was the only size available at the time. I like how the stone is turned on an angle as it makes it more unique and different and not like an engagement ring. For the price and the stone and quality of the ring this is a bargain.

 Stunning Stone This ring is a real beauty. Surprisingly the stone color looks exactly like the main image provided for this product by the seller not the lighter-colored picture! It is the saturated blue color of a beautiful sapphire at a fraction of the price. The stone is also of substantial size approx. 1/4 inch square tipped on its side.Although the stone is very flat it has depth within the setting. I like the low profile because it is easier to wear for working. Though there are no chips in my ring upon arrival

 Very Very SPARKLEY! I bought this to bling up my ankle for summer short season. It is very sparkley & does not go unnoticed. The sterling pieces between the Swarovski crystals are tubes and it is all held together by heavy clear 'fishing line' type craft cord and seems sturdy so far. The Swarovski crystals are clear but have the aurora borealis finish so they flash a rainbow of bright colors. Very pretty anklet!

 not nearly as dark brown as in the photo I like this necklace cord OK but it is not as dark a brown as in the photo (where it looks almost black). instead it's a medium brown color. the difference in color gives it more of a casual Western/cowboy type of look. also the title of the item clearly states "dark brown leather cord" and I thought it was real leather until I just noticed the descriptive paragraph lists it as "faux leather." this is a difference in quality that should be addressed in the title.

 Pearl Drop Earrings - Sardelli The description for this earrings should say - Children's Jewelry. So tiny and I find the quality so poor. This must be made in either China or Thailand where most cheap jewelry nowadays come from. Will learn a lesson next time.

 Cute but... These earrings are nice for $5 but I wouldn't pay $20 for them. The longest dangle is 30mm in length the middle one is 25mm and the shortest is 20mm. The stones are 5mm. Unfortunately the pair I received had the longest dangle in the front and the shortest in the back. They don't look good that way

 Beautiful but too small to engrave This item is priced well but it is WAY too small to engrave anything on that anyone could read - not to mention that the back is not smooth it's 'pebbly'. The best use for it is to hang it off an existing medical id bracelet near the clasp so that if the face plate is turned around the caduceus is visible.

 A neccessity if your health demands it The chain and medallion are stainless steel strong and rustproof. You can get one listing whatever your condition is on the back discretely. The chain is just long enough to fit over your head removing the need for a lock - always the weak spot of any chain. My only criticism is that the red plastic Cadceus alerting paramedics of your needs fell off soon after I bought it.

She loves penguins but looking at this it seems a bit corny and childish. Well it is not. She loves this belly button ring so much its awesome.

The artist of this piece created a show stopper!!

 beautiful but broken I would have easily given this necklace 5 stars BUT I wore it once and the black silk cord that it's hanging on broke! Broke in a way that's not easily fixed. I do love it though and it's like no necklace I've ever seen before. I get lots of compliments on it. I'm going to purchase a new black cord so I can wear it again. It's not worth sending back just for another cord.

 I loved these at first!!! My husband and I were a week away from getting married and still could not agree on our wedding band set. We came across these and instantly fell in love with them.. I ordered them right away and got them 2 days later. The color on the bands were perfect and the outside of the ring was smooth and beautiful.. It was exactly what we wanted.. We haev been married for 3 weeks today and we are so unhappy with the quality of these rings. The color is coming off of mine and is almost completely off my husbands and they are scratched.. I thought titanium was the strongest metal and that if wouldn't scratch... The seller is trying to work with us to make us happy.. I guess we'll see.

 Round cut amethyst ring Overall I'm pretty satisfied with this ring and this seller (Peora). The gemstone Amethyst is simply beautiful. It sparkles as brightly as shown in the picture. I'm really satisfied with the gemstone.However the conventional wisdom of "you get what you pay for" rings true!! The only thing that I'm not happy with is the silver/metal of the ring. It's not exactly superior quality or the 925 silver or pure silver or stainless steel that I'm used to wearing. The silver is thin and light and at a close distance

 Good idea but bad execution This ring is supposedly designed so that you can wear it with the tag hanging down (as shown) or in the reverse with the tang hanging from the top. In the latter position the tag is quite heavy and the slightest motion causes the ring to protrude up which stretches the hole a great deal and makes it very easy to snag or see through clothing. In the position pictured the ring will not fit at all in any size piercing because the tag is actually curved and bows out. The barbell is not long enough to accommodate this curve and the tag will either pull the ring out or flip over so it is upside down. Certainly not worth 19.99 nor even 1.99.

 4 items ordered; 3 going back Wolf Dream Catcher is actually smaller than pictured. While it is nice one must look closely to figure out what the medallion actually is. Light but sturdy. The beaded adornments slide along the cord freely and with some work on your part it might hang at its longest nicely.However the cord is quite thin and disappointing and seems to be permanently curled from packaging and shipping position. No matter what I do I cannot seem to straighten the cord so it hangs evenly. There are several twists and curls in it that make it look dumb. Although it is adjustable by a simple pull-the-knot-through-the-loop closesure it doesn't stay where you put it. The slightest movement and it drops back to its longest.This would be much nicer on a chain that hangs appropriately. However

 I'm guessing its because its Pewter I don't really like the quality of it. When you start to bend it around your wrist you can hear it almost crackling. I'm guessing this is because its Pewter which I'm not familiar with but I'm sure I wont purchase anything Pewter again. It looks like it would be a nice weight and feel but it just feels thin and brittle when you bend it you can sort of see it get bubbled cracks(thats the best way I can describe it). I thought from the previous reviews that I would like it.. But I don't. It's a 50/50 product I guess. All in all I'm dissapointed and I know I won't be wearing it anytime soon.

 It suxs I just hate this product and ill tell u why. For starters its to flimsy it bends way to easly. After a few days from having it it stareted to get a hair line crack right next to the wolf. I wore it to dinner with my husband and it got snaged on my purse when i was geting something out and it just bent all the way back and snaped off. This pruduct suxs and im glad they arnt selling this awfull thing no more. I would not recomend it to no one. and yes this product does have a beautifull wolf on it but its just not a good sturdy metal.

 Great timeless piece I lusted after the Tiffany's version of this ring forever and finally thought I would give this one a try before shelling out $200. I love it!! Ordering a size bigger is a great piece of advice though. I did this and it fits nicely and isn't too thick or uncomfortable. The silver is of good quality and wears well. Add their coordinating mesh bracelet and you have a polished look for a fraction of the designer price!

 Great Ring For The Price This ring will save you a lot of money when comparing it to Tiffany. Anyone looking for a nice classy looking piece of jewelry that can be worn everyday without fear of losing something expensive should take a good look at this ring. I did however think this ring would be a bit brighter color wise when it came but I was disappointed to see it was darker. The picture shown when I bought it showed a brighter looking ring however the picture shown now is accurate. Also I did have one issue with the ring and it was that one of the loops on the end were not closed all the way and would get caught on clothing. A very simple fix of taking needle nose pliers and a cloth and pinched it to where it should be and never had a problem since. The free ground shipping is something I would stay away from and just pay for upgraded shipping. I had it shipped the free shipping and it took 4-5 days to arrive when the company shipped it from the same state I live in less than an hour away. I am going to go ahead and blame USPS but it was getting close to the deadline for Christmas and I was afraid it was not going to show up on time. The company shipped the items I ordered the same day. I did contact customer service about the shipping and the person I spoke with was very polite and accommodating to my requests and questions and was willing to make things right and help me get what I needed for Christmas if the items didn't come by a certain date. Overall I would recommend this ring to anyone looking for a silver mesh ring and this company for any other jewelry as their prices are hard to beat the quality is good and the customer service is top notch.

 Beutiful - but possible a little too princessy This necklace really is a stunner.I've been wedding shopping and buying lots of jewelry here (mostly from Peora) because it's affordable and high quality. Some pieces were too dainty and some over-the-top. This necklace might be too much. It looks like it's made for a princess. I mean a real royal-family princess. Which I'm not so I'm not sure I can pull it off. It looks too real to seem like "obviously costume" jewelry but too big to be believably real.I ordered it at the same time as Peroa's "Inspired Elegance" earrings. This necklaces matches those earrings perfectly (and it all matches my round cut 4-prong engagement ring) and those earrings are definitely the winners for the wedding. This necklace is beautiful but the diamonds and whole piece is large enough that people will wonder if it's fake or if you rented/bought a $40

When I received my refund I decided to try this ring despite the photo. I got it this morning and couldn't be happier. The setting is solid and of a very fine quality silver. Much nicer than the photo provided. The stone is a deep red without a hint a brown in it and I love the "east-west" setting. This ring is sizeable without being a "knuckle-duster". It's just big enough to be seen yet not too big to wear to work every day. It's elegantly simple and doesn't overpower my small hands. It even compliments the rather ornate wide band I wear on the other hand. Don't hesitate to order this ring

 Pretty but... It was just "okay." I sent it back but only because I needed a special piece for a wedding. This would have fit the bill if it weren't for the fact that it was jointed and wouldn't lay flat. Because it kept twisting and turning you lost the look of it. Also the clasp was very small and hard to open. It took me about five minutes to get the necklace off by myself. In the end I decided that it was a bit too "chokery" in length

 A Little goes a Long Way! These delicate earrings are a lovely addition to other pieces from the Peora London Blue Topaz collection. We added these earrings to a ring and necklace to create a beautiful set for our daughter; whose birthday is in December.She is as delighted with the quality and craftsmanship of the earrings as we are. They look lovely on the ear; especially if one's hair is short or worn swept away from the ear. The earrings are the perfect size for looking elegant. We are most pleased with our purchase!

 Somewhat disappointed I purchase a LOT of jewelry and have done so for the past decade or more. Quite honestly I think this pendant and chain are on the lightweight side. Had hoped the combo would arrive a little more substantial. If I had any assurance of finding something similar but more substantial this would be returned in a heartbeat. Still pondering returning and what else I could do for my expecting step-daughter.

 Beautiful but it fell apart My husband gave me this necklace for my first Mother's Day since the birth of my son. Unfortunately the cameo fell out of it only about 3 months after I recieved it! It's completely lost. I almost cried because it really is a beautiful piece. My suggestion is that if you buy this check it often or perhaps even see if a jewelry shop can reinforce the setting for you.

 So disappointed!!!!!! I purchased this necklace for my daughter having her first child. Gave it to her at her baby shower on Nov.3. It brought tearsshe loved it so much. A month later she had to purchase a new chain for it. Last week the cameo came out of the rim she barely tried to push it back in and it broke in half. It lasted almost 2 months not counting the chain. It was something she wanted to keep for a lifetime. So disappointed!!!!!

 Wonderful Piece of Jewelry I must admit.. I was a little concerned the ring wouldnt look as nice as the picture when I ordered it.. but the price was so great I couldnt pass up trying it. It is a wonderful piece. I was totally thrilled when I saw it.. couldnt help thinking how much my daughter is going to love this at christmas. Infinity jewelry was the only thing she asked me to find for her and I know she is going to love this. I bought a sterling silver necklace at Target & wasnt totally thrilled with it when I bought it but it was the only infinity item I could find in a store. This is a piece I know she will be totally happy with and so will you! Dont hesitate to buy it.. you will love it especially when the price is so little and the ring is so pretty!

 Tangles Necklaces I got this for my wife at Christmas. We then had to travel across country from SC to WA. During the trip she kept some of her jewelry in this case. You know the stuff she wears all the time. Well I spent hours untangling all her necklaces. They slip into the top of the case and are held in place by a little hook. The other end is free to move around. Presto! tangled necklaces. There is no way to hold the bottoms in place and if the case turns upside down (which happens when your moving luggage) the necklace slips off the top clip. Very disappointed.

 Delicate lovely and expensive looking. My favorite pair of pearl earrings kept losing pearls. I have been looking for something similar for years.

 DONT MEASURE UP I bought a lovely necklace that Amazon featured this set of earrings as well as a bracelet with as a "buy together for" deal. I was SO incredibly disappointed with these earrings! These were described as 4-5 mm and the length 1.75". The image alone is deceiving. The actual "pearl" portion is only 1" long (see images I uploaded). If the seller had featured a picture of them being worn I would have seen the pearls & overall earrings were much smaller. My husband an engineer measured the pearls with a caliper and found they were 3 mm at best only 2 were 4 mm. The freshwater pearl necklace (from a different seller) looks NOTHING like these earrings and together look mismatched so I gave the earrings to my teenage daughter. For a 16 year old

 very pretty; glad the seller has listened to feedback! I really like the earrings though the other reviewer was correct--they are smaller than what the image/height stat. suggested. So I'm really pleased that there are new images up with a measurement guide to avoid future confusion. But overall I'm pleased.

 Very small ad for China This is more of a charm than a keychain... If that's what you're looking for buy away! However the side of the shamrock that isn't shown has a relatively big stamp (not a sticker that can be removed) in the metal that says "CHINA." Not quite the Irish spirit I was looking for.

 Not sure if it's sterling? This charm has a goldish tint to it that made me think maybe it wasn't authentically sterling but it was stamped with 925 as well as a GIANT "China" imprint. Not very pleased with the color or the stamp.

 EXTREMELY SMALL CHARM I expected this charm to be much bigger and didn't think to check the measurements when it popped up as my search for a &#34;four leaf clover key chain.&#34; It is EXTREMELY small. about the size of my finger nail. So if that is what you are looking for than this is the purchase for you. If you were looking for a key chain as I was don't waste your money. It barely fits on my key ring.

 It's not a keychain! My biggest problem with this product is actually my fault. I searched for &#34;four leaf clover keychain&#34; and this was the first item on the list. I did not read the entire name of the item which ends in &#34;charm&#34; or the description. The picture gave me no size reference so it actually looked like a keychain. And of course it was exactly what I was looking for in a keychain sooo... I bought it! Needless to say I was very disappointed when I received it and it was no bigger than an eraser head! So I just want to make sure everyone understands its a charm for a charm bracelet and not a keychain!Besides this minor complaint I gave it only two stars because if I were purchasing a charm for my sister or girlfriend then I still would have been disappointed!

 Best for very small child/toddlers - really tiny Bought these for my 9 year old niece for christmas and was slightly disappointed in them. They are really small. You have to have tiny ears to be able to notice that you even have them on. So I'd only recommend them for toddlers and younger children pre-school who have pierced ears. Quality is decent sterling silver and they are probably ok for moms to put on their toddlers because they will stay nicely due to the good screw backing. Butkids a little older who usually put their own earrings in might be disappointed and will probably have trouble putting them in themselves. They are so tiny (looks like about 1/4") it's difficult to hold them to put them in and they will also be lost easily. Probably good for a small child who won't want to change their earrings very often and maybe keep them in or if mom can do it for her. They might also be good for anyone with multiple piercings who want a few tiny earrings to go with their central earring.

 unsatisfied I bought this navel ring awhile ago with clear crystals I thought it was cute and I liked how it is movable. Unfortunately only a couple days after wearing it one jewel fell out and shortly after that another one fell out too. So I stopped wearing it altogether. I also bought another belly ring from the same company and that one began to tarnish quickly So I don't think I will be taking any more chances ordering from this company any more.

 Nice looking but could be better. The two middle slots are narrower than the two outside slots which I don't care for. Remotes can be bulky.

 Good for the price This crab charm was a great find for me - ruby is my birthstone and Cancer (the Crab) is my Zodiac sign. I've been looking for a Crab charm/pendant and also for something with rubies for a while so this charm was perfect for me. It arrived today and I like it - it's pretty and delicate and the perfect size I've been planning to wear it on a chain as a small pendant and at about 1/2" long and 1/2" wide it's just the right size for that. It appears to be well-made the silver is bright and shiny and even though I tend to prefer antiqued silver and marcasite

 The perfect gift for a Cancer My best friend of 30+ years is a Cancer. I'd searched for 20 years for a tiny crab charm and finally found this adorable sterling silver ruby encrusted crab charm. She was delighted by it; and told me she'd been looking for one since she was a teenager.

 Ruby Crab Charm/purchased at amazon Beautiful Charm. Many compliments. Looks very expensive. Can be worn as a charm on a necklace or as I use it on my pandora charm bracelet. Stones are set very nicely. Would buy again.

 Beautiful and resilient! My brother bought me a pair of these for xmas last year. I'm a bit clumsy so sadly I've dropped each of them multiple times on hard floors (e.g. ceramic tile). The only damage they've sustained is minor chipping of the tips and you can't even tell without looking up close since they still come to a point.At first I figured this would be the only glass pair I'd ever own since I'm such a klutz but after seeing how well these stand up to impact I'm hoping to get more soon.My only concern is that they seem to be a smidgen narrower than some other 00g jewelry I have but I've encountered minor size variations from multiple makers so I have to conclude that it's inevitable.They're every bit as beautiful as they look in the pictures!

 Poor quality photo misrepresented item I found these cufflinks to be poor quality and barely resembling the photo in the listing. The silver tone film had bubbles on the face of the piece the craftmanship was rough and inprecise. Overall I was quite dissapointed. The vendor handled the return satisfactorily promptly and courteously.

 Sweet Ring for Dolphin lovers My niece asked me for a sapphire ring for her tenth birthday. It's not easy to find rings of good quality for children. This ring isn't a child's ring per se but it comes in size four which fits my niece's index finger and it will give her plenty of room to grow into it and even use it as a pinky ring when she's in college. The sapphire is small but I think that's fine. It is proportional to the rest of the ring. The ring I received had a nice blue sapphire - clearly a sapphire and not muddy. The styling makes it wrap nicely around the finger and it won't snag sweaters like so many rings do. My niece and I both like the smoothness of the dolphin's body. It's a shiny metal that doesn't look like it will tarnish but it's too early to know. It cleans easily with a soft jewelry cloth and also responded well to very mild soap and water. This is an excellent buy.

 Strong little earrings! I purchased these for my uncle who is a very large man with large earlobes. He wanted a gold hoop that was strong enough to be left in and slept in noticable without being flashy and would fit his earlobe! I was hesitant to order them fearing they wouldnt work I contacted the seller and they responded very quickly to my questions and were very helpful. Needless to say my uncle loves them and they have held up great!!

They are hard to get in (but I knew they would be these types of hoops are the most difficult to get in) I have 5 holes in each ear and I bought these for my new 5th hole. They are newly pierced so this is why I had difficulty. They are just perfect. I will be back to buy another pair. Simple elegant. A++++

 Good value for a good price I bought four of these necklaces as gifts for my bridesmaids. The necklace quality was uniform for all four (there were slight differences between the stones but as they are natural and not synthetic that is to be expected). The quality of all 4 necklaces was good very pretty stones and settings and I really liked the box chain. The color is slightly more a green-blue than the royal blue in the picture but still very pretty. Overall great value for the price.

 Gorgeous! This armoire @ $300 is priced like smaller/lesser quality/less attractive items at places like Bombay Company here in FL & other sellers online. It arrives very well packed via Fedex (Amazon emails a tracking #) & the only assembly is attaching the lid with the included screws. It is very sturdy & has LOTS of space. And of course it's beautiful. The photos (which are great) don't do it justice. This is a bargain for the price. No regrets. Will deal with Everything Furniture again if the opportunity presents itself.

 Poor Craftsmanship This is a real nice bracelet the problem is where the shiny part meet the matte part. The line seperating the the two is very rough some parts that should be matte is shiny & some parts that should be shiny is matte. For a bracelet to list for a price of 400.00 should have showed better Quality & Craftsmanship. I should have returned this item but I dont have the time nor the patience.

 Good quality for $32; This is the small version of the Sevillana I have been eyeing the Sevillana ring for a few months ago but I was scared to pull the trigger because of its very unique and bold design. When I saw this replica for sale for a fraction of the price I thought it would be a good way to 'test drive' the jewelry before buying the real deal.I received the ring today and I was impressed by the weight and look of the ring. You can barely tell it's a replica when its on my finger. However there are 3 small differences that the buyer should be aware of

 Best $32 Spent! One of my co-workers has this ring from Tiffany's. I loved it so much but wasn't ready to spend $250 on it. Instead I found this ring from Eve's Addication. The ring size guide makes it easy to determine which size to select. The ring came in a small blue velvet bag and matching box. It is .925 sterling silver which is the same quality of Tiffany jewelry. The back is hollow so it is not solid which does not bother me because no one ever sees it. I actually compared my ring to my co-worker's and you couldn't tell much difference! Eves Addiction also included a pair of CZ princess cut earrings since my purchase was more than $75 and I received free shipping. This is the best $32 I have spent!

 Netaya Diamond Dangle Earrings I got these for valentines day and I was a little disappointed at first when I first opened the box but after wearing them out I changed my opinion of them.

 Gorgeous This necklace looks great on my wife. She loves it. It looks great in the ad picture and just as pretty if not more so in real life.I was concerned that the ad pic might make it appear to look better or more brilliant than it actually does. Not so. when I viewed it up close I was completely satisfied with my choice.It rests nicely when worn- doesn't fold in on itself- maintains it's spread apart shape. That is the way it appears in the photo.The box it comes in is decent as well. Not something you would be ashamed to give as a gift that is. So no need to go pick up a handsome secondary box to place it in.Again totally happy with my choice here.

 Doesn't work I wore this necklace several times and now realize that I wasted my money. I can't even tell the necklace even has any titanium ... there is no magnetic field. If you want true titanium (no clothe cover)and that does seem to work ... stay way from the 'cloth' covered ones since you can't verify what is underneath unless to disassemble to necklace. I would not recommend this to anyone.

 Great This was a good item for the price...i cant really say that it is a miracle worker but it does feel pretty solid and good. if you end up not liking the way it works than its still a cool necklace to have for the price.

 The item is good but... I ordered two 18" but received a 18" and a 22" obviously I can't wear the 22" one. I'm an international buyer so it's a bit expensive to return this item however I donated the 22" one to a local charity sale. Since I can't wear this necklace myself I'm not sure if it works well so this 3-star rating is given to the seller for shipping a wrong item.

 Great buy I purchased this for my husband. I found one in my town for 10.00 more exact same product so this one is a steal! He liked it and has had no complaints although the 18" seems to be a bit smaller than that maybe due to the thickness of the weave around the titanium wire. Good buy.

 What I was hoping for... I purchased this necklace in hopes that some of my daily aches and pains would lessen; I am still a skeptic by heart and hoping that all my aforementioned A&P;'s would completely be eradicated by the wearing of this necklace seemswellsilly.It is comfortable to wear (although I do wish I had chose the next size longer for appearance sake.) and not at all heavy.All in all I would recommend buying this piece to anyone who wants to give it a chance. If I am able to do cartwheels in a few months I'll report back to let you know.

I wear it when I work out and it could be improving my stability and strength but I can't tell whether or not it works.If you are buying this as a miracle cure I would caution against it but if you like the look of it then get it.

 Phiten necklace 22" It is comfortable and stylish but that is not why I bought it. I have neck problems and was looking for relief from low grade pain that often shows up. It seems to help although it is hard to tell with these things. Nothing scientific but I truly think it reduces and sometimes eliminates the mild pain I have had intermittently for a long time. There may even be a slight energy boost but that is minimal for me.

 Really Works! I have had two back surgeries and am usually in constant pain but once I put this on and kept it on for more than a week it really helped out my lower back pain. Don't get me wrong this is not a miracle necklace in any way but it did greatly reduce the pain for a while. Once I had to take it off to go back to work (military) I noticed the back pain came back quickly. It made me fill a bit more energetic during the day and is easy to conceal under a t-shirt if you don't want people to ask a lot of questions (I would suggest 22" or larger). Great product...I plan on buying the wrist bracelet next.

 Works well but no miracle So my ankle has suffered for about 10 years or so. I have worn a goofy flat shoe that doesn't flex before. I got the necklace and double wrapped around my ankle. It started to feel strange(kinda warm) at first. My first thought was"oh great my brain thinks it is doing something". After a while of not thinking or noticing it i could walk upstairs without my ankle hurting. I am a sceptic so i took it off for a few days. My ankle hurt again while walking upstairs. This is NOT a cure. When the weather changes like rain/cold still hurts a bit. I got the cheapest one possible

 An incredible pain reducer! I have had this necklace for over a month now and I have been using it constantly. I am in chronic pain some of witch is in my face and neck. And I have been using very strong magnets to help. But I find this product to be extremely effective at reducing and many times eliminating the pain. It does better than the magnets; and it even helps me sleep better than I have in years.I cannot say enough about this product because it really works. I just bought the wristbands to help with the pain in my hands and arms. Also one for my wife she finds it helps with her headaches.I learned about this from watching professional baseball and seeing that most of the players are using it to help with relaxing and their pain. Now I see why they are all using it.

 cool necklace doesn't work though You probably saw some baseball players wearing this necklace and are curious. Does it work as advertised? Nah. It looks cool and I enjoy wearing it but it does nothing for pain or tension or stiffness etc. I know it's very popular in baseball (I myself work for MLB) but at the same time baseball players are very superstitious and considering these come in various colors and can be braided

 I'm a believer I'm an active 49 year old female who was having chronic hip and knee pain especially when sleeping. Last month Amazon had great special on the PHITEN stuff so I gave it a try. I'm a believer. No more hip and knee pain. I wear the necklace 24/7 except in shower and have purchased the titanium discs and stick them on any spots that feel sore after a strenuous day. The products are amazing. What have you got to lose with Amazon's excellent return policy.

 Customer Service Sucks I have also seen many people wear these. I workout a lot. I decided to order two braclets and measured my wrist at 7 1/8 and order 7 1/2. I could not close the clasp. I sent them back only to have them returned!!! They told me it was custom- I order one black and one orange- how is that custom. I talked to two CS reps with the same answer- non-refundable!! They could have saved one customer by giving the correct size and sending back instead they go to the expense of writing a letter and postage to send back the braclets.I have many people ask me about these in the gym- I can now tell them- DO NOT BUY THE CS SUCKS. I guess I will find some kid in Middle School with skinny wrist and give it to them. I'm blown away.

 Read the package make-source I personally used the tape and the e-water lotion together and the combination effectively subdue my neck-shoulder ache which I have for many years. I applied the lotion daily after bath at night and replace the tape every 2-3 days. I am convinced with the technology that I decided to try their jewellery products since having the tape seen on body is not a pretty sight to public eye. Before I make any haste/impulse purchase I googled for the product reviews and realised it is a mixed reviews - ~50

 Great gift for a hard to please baseball fan I know it's only a necklace but my husband is so hard to buy gifts for and he's a major Red Sox fan so this was a great gift. I guess many baseball players wear these(the superstitious ones) to enhance their game. The necklace is suppose to have titanium in it thus producing "majical powers". What ever the case my husband was surprised I noticed the players wearing them and has worn his every day since recieving it. Now that I think of it he has improved in certain areas

 Not exactly as it appears We have several Phitens - all of which are in the blue or black family. My daughter wanted an orange one since her team colors are orange and white. In the photo this looks like it is truly orange - and bright! The reality is that it's not. It's a very dingy color nearly brownish and it almost looks as though it's gone through mud and then someone attempted to wash it. Suffice it to say I bought it for her for xmas

 Nonsense This bracelet doesn't contain any "ions" "technology" nor "energy" which would noticeably affect the human body at all.Magic bracelets with different metals and magnets in them have been LONG PROVEN USELESS. Do you know who first debunked these things? *BENJAMIN* *FRANKLIN* did two hundred years ago!He found out that it didn't matter whether he put metals or magnets or pieces of painted wood in them people couldn't tell the difference. He told people they would increase strength eliminate pain and cure all sorts of diseases with mysterious "energies". Of course it was nonsense but most people who bought them nevertheless claimed that they "worked".It's just a bracelet. No ions. No technology. No energy. No magic.Buy this bracelet only if you want to show the world that you don't have a clue.

 Who needs medicine?!?! I bought this because I was very sick with no hope in sight until someone recommended the Phiten Star Necklace. I put it on and instantly felt better. No more treatments for me! I threw all my meds out the window and got a ticket for littering but I no longer needed them is what I am trying to say.Not only that I was running faster jumping higher and could levitate. I have never had these abilities before but thanks to the Phiten Star Necklace I was like a super-human. Nevermind that this is just another new-age trend with tweens and these do as much as you holding a marble in the fly of your underwear. These did so much it was amazing and I promise it isn't just all in my head or your heads collectively. My friend saw what happened with me and wanted to one-up me

 I can't believe it but it really seems to work! I bought this titanium necklace just to try one more alternative treatment for my joint pains and was really pleasantly surprised. It seems to be actually helping. I take tons of supplements and use magnets as well as the Q-ray ring/bracelet but this is the first item that seemed to immediately help decrease the pain in my joints. I'll have to see how it fairs as time goes by but if constantly wearing a rather ugly necklace is the price to pay so be it. I can't say it'll help everyone who tries it but it definitely seems to be relieving my joint pains. Yehhhhh.....something that REALLY works!!

 These are great! I had back pain for about a year. After seeing these necklaces being worn by a ton of Major League Baseball players I decided to give one of these a try. Next thing I knew my back pain was gone. Coincidence? Maybe. But when I forget to put it back on after a shower I sometimes feel pain again. These are very light weight and comfortable.

 Fewer Aches and Pains I am a chronic sufferer of back and neck pain. An accident several years ago left me with a fractured vertebrae and more pain than I know how to deal with. I watch a lot of baseball on TV and saw a lot of players wearing this and decided to give it a try. This product(along with a weekly workout regimen) has helped me deal with and exceed my own standards of pain tolerance. I don't know whether it's a mind-over-matter type of experience but at this point I don't really care. If you deal with aches and pains similar to these I would definitely give this a try.

 Works for my shoulder I've been wearing it for 3 weeks now. I have sciatic due to a herniated disc. I was hoping this will relieve pain. I guess it's not that powerful to wear it on the neck to get rid of the pain in my low back. I also got the bracelet which really works for my wrist elbo and shoulder. Well it's probably the combination of the necklace and bracelet that make them feel pretty much pain free. They are painful because I am a Programmer and work on the computer all day.I would say this product works. I may be buying the waist belt that is not sold here.

 Helps with pain from drumming I'm a drummer who does a lot of session work and driving around to gigs who deals with chronic back and neck pain. I've been through chiro treatment and use all sorts of inversion tables back rests and braces to help deal with the pain of muscle stress and tension in my back and neck. Sometimes this pain spreads to my ribs and other areas so my pain simply comes from tense muscles no disc compressions or anything like that. After buying this at a local sport shop and putting it on I got into my car and slouched down into my seat (something I don't usually do because of the pain in my lower back) and drove to where I needed to be not even realizing that my pain had went away. After wearing this necklace for a few days

 Perfect Gift for 12 y/o Grandson Our grandson wanted a Phiten necklace for his 12th birthday ... this was a last-minute purchase but it arrived even quicker than expected so it was here in time for his birthday. Sometimes it is hard to impress a tween ... this gift was warmly received and is worn every day. Now a younger grandchild is putting this item on her Christmas wish list.

 Not happy... Whatsoever. Very very very dissatisfied with this order... NOT the correct size. NOT the item pictured. Not the item titled. Says 18" but it came as 22". I have a small neck... However it shipped/arrived extremely quickly. ONLY good thing about ordering this item. I could have gotten pretty much the SAME EXACT item for $4.99 from another seller on Amazon. Stole $10 from me.

 Atleast it looks cool! Well I got what I ordered. Does it work for me? No. Besides wearing it as a fashion item this necklace serves no other purpose. If you are having pains in your body try stretching or heading to the gym. I promise that will work better than some gimmick.

 It works! I thought that was bunk and I laughed when my husband bought especially since I'm the one that has had chronic back and neck pain for the last 3 years - 2 of the years of consistent chiropractic work at least 3 times a week. We recently moved and things improved drastically with only the occasional neck pain I'm assuming from less stress then this morning I woke up with a killer headache and could barely move my head from the stiffness and pain in my neck. I took my husbands necklace and laid in bed after dozing off for an hour I woke up and things were 90% better. I then cracked my neck and we were at 98% I took the necklace off long enough to take a shower and by the time I got out my neck was locking up again so I put it on for the remainder of the day until my husband got home. I'm ordering mine asap it was enough to convince me - although I *hate* the look

 Not so good This item was definitely NOT what I thought it would be. It was not made with Swarowski crystals it was made with plastic beads. The Sterling Silver took exactly 1 day to completely tarnish to a very rusty color. I bought it for a gift and obviously could not give it to anyone that I cared even remotely about. Very cheap looking and tacky. Will never purchase anything like this again from this company.

 Mr. Christmas brand not "Gold Label" This is a cheaply made item that doesn't work well. The box doesn't close properly as the wood is unevenly cut and placed together.

 adorable and has good sound This was a gift for my two year old daughter - I know she is too young to play with it by herself but she is quite good about not destroying things and we just tell her "one finger touch" and she is very gentle with such items. This box has a great sound to it like a music box should (as long as you are not expecting the true mechanical quality of a $200 German music box). The lit tree and rotating ring of skaters make it a great keepsake that we will pull out every Christmas and enjoy.

 Pretty but poorly made Admittedly a $[...] jewelry box is not going to be heirloom quality and its appearance is certainly pretty enough for the 4-yr-old daughter I bought it for. To my adult eye the box has the appearance of hardened cardboard and the ballerina is painted plastic of the cheesiest kind. The real flaw is that the mechanism that stops and starts the music is of the crudest kind

 Ballerina Jewelry Box This product was subpar. I ordered it as a going-away gift for a colleague we dubbed - the Dancing Queen. When it came it looked used although it did not state such on the order. When wound the ballerina twirled for about 30 seconds and then stopped never to dance again- no matter what we tried. I would not recommend this product to anyone- especially if it is for a child.

 Great for a little girl I got this jewelry box as a gift for my 3-year-old niece. She absolutely loves it! It's not the highest construction but it's solid enough for everyday use. She did flick at the ballerina which made it stop turning for a moment. Winding the box again solved that problem. The winding mechanism is a little hard for 3-year-old fingers but she was able to give it a small turn - enough to satisfy her attention span.

 Wish I had seen the top of the box! I didn't think about it when I purchased it - I liked all that I saw. But I don't like the image on the top of the box - it isn't flowers like the side - it's a ballerina. The inside is pretty but the box looks a lot cheaper in reality. Poor quality construction. Not really bad for the price compared to other boxes online but not what I would consider a great find. I'll be watching for a different box while I shop in person after this experience.

 just what i wanted this box is the perfect size for my 3 year old- smaller than other boxes but big enough for her. it's very cute and the quality/sturdiness appears to be good. the music is somewhat loud for a music box but my daughter loves it.

 Great but ballerina didn't last This jewelry box is very cute... like I had growing up. BUT the ballerina on ours has quit spinning when tbe box is opened after only 5 months. It continues to spin when the box is closed and then needs to be rewound with each opening. My daughter has been VERY careful with it so I dont think it's from rough usage. But she still enjoys it and uses it!

 could have been Could have been the cutest gift but was not.The mirror is not shaped as a heart. First problem.The music is fantastic and in the end we bought it for that specific tune. First good point.After less than 2 weeks of DD (age 6) opening it the poor ballerina sprung into action (literally) and this caused the poor ballerina to fall apart

 Appears Lighter in Color than Pictured I'm glad the stones are lighter in color than pictured because in my opinion they are more attractive than pictured. The stones are multi-faceted and the butterfly backings are just the right size. I never cared for those tiny butterfly backings that are nearly impossible to find if you drop one on the floor. Lovely earrings.

 Don't Buy I'm 20 years old and I bought this ring as a promise ring for my girlfriend. At first it was beautiful and there were no problems but she has had it for a little over a month and it has given her such a bad rash that she has started bleeding. This is not real sterling silver and looks poorly made. I would definitely never suggest anyone buy this ring.

 Bland The picture reflects a warm coffee bean brown color for the jasper. I understand that natural stones vary a great deal in color but the jasper (the largest stone) in my earrings was the color of oatmeal with a few dark brown flecks. I can wear them with beige clothing but they are not what I expected based on the picture.

 Beautiful and simple It's a delicate bracelet and something that sits simply on the wrist but that hasn't stopped me from getting compliments on it.

 Trendy and Classy When I saw this on sale for about $16 I got it right away and took advantage of the free shipping (for orders over $45). It's such a trendy yet classy design. I haven't worn it that much but it looked really nice on my wrist when I wore it. I'm really skinny so it's a little loose on me but it still looks fine (about 7" long)... draping over the back of my hand as I move.Bonus

 Good Platinum Solitare Setting I'm not exactly sure how to review an engagement ring setting but here goes. Its a fairly affordable platinum setting. I bought it as part of the engagement ring for my (now) fiancee. The setting is shiny and heavy just like it should be. Its a little bit on the heavy side which is a side effect of choosing platinum rather than white gold but it won't dull as much. My only complaint is that Amazon didn't offer rings in quarter sizes. However rounding to the nearest half-size didn't make a big difference and the ring looks great on my fiancee's finger.

 beautiful necklace I purchased this product for my sister's birthday. We live 3 hours apart and I wanted something that could be delivered directly to her. Since her birthday is in August I decided her birthstone peridot was the way to go. After searching many sites online I found this beautiful necklace through Amazon. It was delivered quickly to her in a pretty box and she was delighted when she opened it. I haven't seen it in person yet but she was thrilled and told me how gorgeous it is.

 Classy but silver tarnishes First let me say this is a classy-looking necklace! But the peridot is a lot less intensely green than the picture makes it look unless it's against the right color background. It also won't hang quite like the picture shows--I swear that the angle of the part that the zirconium is mounted on is less steep and you're also definitely going to get a really obvious bend where the chain meets that part.More importantly though

 The coolest bling around The Wolfwood Cross Punisher necklace is amazing. Once I got past the initial awe of having it right in my hands I was dazzled by how well detailed it was.

 Trigun Cross I bought this having a much different image in mind. It's made with durable heavy metal. The detail is beautiful but the back side is dissapointing. There is no detail whatsoever on the backside just a flat surface. It doesnt look anywhere near as cool when the cross flips over and all you see is the flat side.The chain it was on was very nice and it looks very durable. If both sides had been detailed so beautiful I would have given it a 5. Overall

 Matched our furniture perfectly We recently purchased a bedroom suite and needed a short stool to use to put on shoes. Rather than travel all over town looking at furniture stores we decided to shop on line. We are so glad we did. We used a Google image search and found the stool and style we thought would work. Amazon had the best price so we ordered. We were very pleased that it did match the stain and style of the wood in our new bedroom suite perfectly. Each leg bolts on securely and easily. The seat cushion and wood appear to be of excellent quality. We placed it beneath a full length mirror we mounted on the wall behind it. It looks great and we look forward to years of service.

 Caution on the color I don't actually know how well these are going to hold up. They were a gift. However when I got them1) they just came in a bag. No earrings backing which I found strange.2) The color is more green than the picture. I was expecting a nice calm blue. No. More of a bright blue with specks of green and yellow.However they were very pretty nonetheless. Just realize the picture wasn't exactly what we got.

 Beautiful and Useful I use this whistle to call 2 very active English Setters (as pretty as this whistle). It's small so a bit harder to use than a purely functional whistle but since I was wearing a whistle full time it's much nicer to wear and does the trick.Has a nicer sound than some inexpensive whistles I've bought just takes practice getting my lips set "just so" to get the best sound. Does exactly what is is designed to do.Still wearing using and enjoying this whistle in 2011. I wear it as jewelry and use it almost every day on walks with the dogs. Lots of complements and lots of good use.

 Just beautiful! I am so pleased with these earrings! I started shopping around for other sterling silver earrings in the brick and mortar stores after I placed this order because I was getting a little nervous about whether they'd arrive on time (I needed to have them by 12/22). There is just nothing out there that compares with these! The cost was reasonable; the silver is actually sterling silver and the quality and workmanship is great very lustrous no rough edges or thin areas. The size is neither too large nor small and the design is very unusual; nothing I had seen in the stores comes close in uniqueness. I only wish I had purchased another 2 pairs to give as another Christmas gift and one for myself. Don't hesitate in buying these if you think you or someone you know might like them!

 Love the celtic... The earrings arrived in 2 or three days and I did not pay much extra for the shipping. They arrived in good shape(all shiny and new looking) packaged well in a little plastic bag as well as a cloth pouch. Very happy with this order.

 ... Absolutely beautiful... possibly the best set of earring I own. Looks great with everything and looks great with different hairstyles. It also catches the sun really well and looks pretty because of the celtic knot. If you are planning to buy this item because you like it from the picture I suggest you buy it without a doubt. They're the perfect size and they look just like they do in the picture. I'm very happy with my purchase =)

 A Great Buy! I wasn't sure what I was expecting but I took a risk I thought the silver wasn't going to be sturdy but the earrings are super sturdy and well-made. They're also very light lighter than I expected but they add a great finishing touch to any outfit. A great buy!

 elegant and interesting These classy earrings look good either in the office or out on the town. They are medium sized large enough to be seen even if your hair is thick and long but not so large that they overpower. The simple Celtic design complements a variety of clothing and hair styles. The earrings are also comfortable to wear all day. I've worn these many times over the past few months and they remain in perfect condition -- no problems with tarnishing or discoloration. Wear them at work with a soft dress for a relaxed yet professional look. Or try them with a sexy black top and see if they do not make your man a little crazy!

 Sweet Ring! My husband got me this for our anniversary. I've been wanting a new band to go with a very nice engagement ring that he had made for me. This little band matches my engagement band very nicely! When it arrived we realized that we hadn't ordered correctly and the size was wrong. I emailed the company and they replaced with with the correct size. No problems. I was very happy with the company Cool Styles! Of course it's hard to buy jewelry without seeing it and trying it on. This band is a little thinner (thickness wise) than I thought it should be. But for the price it is a good deal.

 Outstanding value I bought this for my wife in the hopes it would be a great piece of casual wear jewelry. It is all that and more. She was thrilled when I gave it to her and it goes well with a sweater and jeans or a nice blue dress. I am thrilled with the quality and the value. Service from Dahlia was great (as always) and I am a loyal customer because they have earned it.

 Disappointed I have a hard time believing that these pearls are AA quality. They are of a very nice size but every single pearl has significant visible flaws. And the luster is not that amazing. Well when you wear them they still look nice but I believe I could get a better product for the price. Previously I purchased pearls from the Amazon collection that were described as A quality. They are nearly perfect and the luster is fantastic. I payed for them significantly less than these pearls that I am reviewing. I was torn between keeping or returning them for a while

My son decided on this ring and he loves it. Shipping was very fast. Had to return the ring for FREE re-sizing and the return was also very quick. The ring looks just as good as any that we would have had to special order at 1/3 of the price. Many thanks.

 Didn't keep it I ordered this bracelet because in the picture it looked mostly purple. Well the stones definitely had a purple AND green hue to them.

 Don't buy from Dashlynn! I ordered a Chefmaster 8 pc BBQ set in case from Amazon.com vendor (Dashlynn.com). I knew what I wanted to give my father for Christmas and after searching the internet I found many different vendors offering the BBQ set I wanted.

 Still a Hot Mama! (With a Belly Ring) So you went through the pain (or bliss whichever floats your boat) of getting a belly button ring...now lo and behold you find yourself pregnant! Oh dear! Well you don't have to fret...you can still manage to be the 'hot mama' you once were BC (Before Children) with this belly button ring! It's awesomely easy to size and extremely comfortable! I was able to wear it all the way up to delivery and would have kept it in if they could have somehow scrubbed it in for the C-section. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 out of 5 is because at first after I cut it to the right size it was a tad bit difficult to screw the little ball on...but that is basically because putting on ANY jewelry when you're pregnant is rather...trying to say the least...but trying to line up a little ball on a little flexible 'stick' while trying to screwing it on straight at the tip of your bulging (and kicking) belly is a feat even for pre-preggo's. Other than that it's a definite 'must buy' if you wanna keep bringing sexy back while you're pregnant

 Not what I thought it was going to be I bought the ring because I had seen pictures in magazines that the bar will flip over and follow the curve of your belly as you grow. I started wearing it at month 6. It never flipped and I ended up taking it out in month 8. However it was a little bit helpful in that the gauge was smaller so I could stretch a little more and didn't end up losing the hole. Now I'm back to my regular rings and they're fine. For 7 bucks you might as well but it's nothing glamorous.

 Perfect! This is just what I was looking for! As I read in other reviews I cut the bar into two pieces. One was one-third the original size the other was the remaining two-thirds. My intent was to start with the 'one-third' and if it showed signs of becoming too small I'd switch to the 'two-thirds'. Well I'm at 32 weeks now and I'm sure I will not outgrow the 'one-third' piece. Plenty of space.

 Beautiful Piece! I got this bracelet as a Christmas gift. It is absolutely gorgeous in person the picture online does not do it justice. It's very eye-catching but not gaudy. I've gotten several compliments on it just since Christmas. My one complaint is that due to the size and shape of the stones and how close they are to the clasp it's a little difficult for me to actually put it on myself - I always need someone to clasp it for me. But that's really a minor thing and I'm sure if I worked at it I could do it myself eventually.

They're called &quot;Pink Shell&quot; earrings but the shell looks pretty white to me...more like mother-of-pearl without a hint of pink. If you're looking for pink these won't be the earrings for you.

 VERY Disappointing This is a real bad purchase. I bought this item to go with my new pink dress. The earrings look pink in the picture but are actually absolutely white. I will return them back and look for a better deal elsewhere.

 Disapointing I also ordered these earrings expecting them to be pink like the pair in the picture. Although they are well made they are white; no hint of pink can be found. These earrings are nice if the color doesn't matter to you  but don't expect them to look like the pair shown.

 my son loves it! My son wanted a non-traditional high school ring. After looking at the local jewelers and finding cost too high I decided to check out the offerings on line. My son decided on this ring and he loves it. Shipping was very fast. Had to return the ring for FREE re-sizing and the return was also very quick. The ring looks just as good as any that we would have had to special order at 1/3 of the price. Many thanks.

 Great Value These are beautiful earrings. I am very happy with them they look as good in reality as they do in the picture. I had originally bought them as a gift but didn't arrive in time for Christmas so I kept them for myself. I am happy I did because I was complimented on them the first time I wore them.

 Beautiful Deal These are truly beautiful earrings - at least for some ears. For me for instance they look great but my friend has attached earlobes and they didn't look too great on her. They are very beautifully designed and if you have the money I'd say it's worth it. I wouldn't wear them on casual occasions in my opinion. I think they are better for formal attires.

 Lovely earrings I didn't find these earrings to be larger than expected nor did I (or any of the people I came across while wearing them today) find them to look fake. The stones are sky blue and perfectly clear. The settings are durable well made and fit exactly as stated with the stones hanging just under the earlobe. Several people commented on them as well as asked the coveted "where-did-you-get-those" question. I'm very pleased with this purchase!

 Bigger than expected These earrings are definitely pretty but I agree with the other reviewers who said they were bigger than they expected. I bought them as a gift for my mother but ended up returning them because they didn't look good on me so I knew they probably wouldn't look good on her. That's not to say they're not nice I just expected something a little daintier.

 Beautiful but not O Clasp This necklace is beautiful shines and lays very nicely. The clasp is not an O clasp but a very tiny lobster clasp that is very hard for people without nails or people with arthritis to work. I have to put it on with the clasp in the front and in front of a mirror. I fumble with the clasp a lot it's very difficult to put on. Other than that it's a pretty necklace and a great value.

 Perfect for Valentines Day My husband got me these earrings as a Valentines Day present. I love them! The garnets are beautiful! I would recomend wearing some kind of stopper on the backs though they tend to come off if you don't. I almost lost mine the first night I got them. Overall I would say deffinately worth buying!

 Cute! This is a beautiful necklace and looks like it's made of good quality materials. I haven't had it long enough to testify to the longevity of the piece but the chain is surprisingly sturdy and the stone is securely set. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating instead of 5 stars is the size. The description is a bit misleading. This pendant is TINY. Really really tiny. It is just over half an inch long and unless you read the description at the bottom

 It's small but nice I wanted to give this as gift to someone but I didn't because I was disappointed when I received it.As someone mentioned the jewel is very small. I know the actual size is mentioned in the description but when I ordered it I didn't understand it actually. It was the size of a finger nail.Another reason I didn't like it was it didn't look as good as the photo. It just didn't. Also the jewelry part doesn't really settle down properly when it is put on the neck;the pendent just sticks out.What I liked about it?-The chain. It was very sturdy. I think I can still use it for something.-The tiny box. I love the purple box that it came with.-The jewel. I love how that green jewel is put properly on the piece. I don't think it would come out randomly.

 Nice! Nice pendant which arrived with lightning speed! Only drawback is that the bale prevents the pendant from lying flat against the chest instead it rocks back & forth. I would have rated this item as four stars if it were not for that one flaw. The cut & color of the peridot are of decent quality & the sterling silver setting is a very nice different design.

 Jewelry Roll is not worth $20 I was looking for a good looking jewelry roll to take with me to jewelry shows and the picture of this one looked pretty good. When I received it I was very disappointed. It's cheap looking and the space where you insert ID is not even big enough for a standard business card. I really don't think this is worth $20 maybe $10. I'm thinking I could find something at the flea market for less money and have it be better looking. It might work for personal use for trips but if you want to look professional look elsewhere.

 Great Heartline Bear charm! I purchased this sterling silver charm to replace one that was identical to it (that I'd had for almost 20 years) and lost somehow this past spring. Something Silver's customer service was wonderful. After a mishap with the US postal service that returned my package back to Something Silver they were nice enough to send it again and covered the cost of that shipping. The packaging was very cute as well!The charm is slightly smaller than my original but I'm so happy to have it!

 Beautiful Little Dainty Pendant If you like feminine jewelry you'll really like this piece. It is small. The combination of the amethyst and peridot is quite attractive. It's beautifully designed. The stones are clear and vibrant set in finished silver. It is smoothly finished both front and back. Even looking at the photograph you can clearly see how well that peridot stone is set. This jewelry is made to last for years...guarantee you that stone will not fall out. The silver has either a rhodium or white gold plating...very nice. The silver is not icy white. Peora's amethyst is every bit as good of quality as their blue topaz

 Perfect gift Bought this as a gift for my daughter-in -law who is going back to school for her MBA. She wanted a "bookbag" that wasn't the canvas bag from undergraduate days. She LOVES the purse and she is VERY particular. The leather is soft the zipper allows for safety and there is room for her many "gadgets". It is a beautiful bag. I recommend it without reservation.JRM

 Looks bad. The bags are stuck together. Do not buy this. Cheap rubber color which make the bags to stick together and and if you try to peel the bags the color will come out. Very bad packaging. They should have given individual paper in between each bag.

 Love them! I absolutely adore these earrings! They are very unique and have excellent craftsmanship. The backs tighten very close to the ear so there are no worries about an earring falling out. The earring is also very well-crafted. I enjoy these very much and hope that they will be available to the public again soon.

 Satisfied Bride I purchased 5 of these for my bridesmaids. The chain is very good quality and sturdy silver. The crystal cluster is also very nice and held together with clear sturdy string. They come separated for you to put together yourself which could allow for you to use the chain for mulitple charms. This also allows the cluster to slide along the chain and it's inserted per gaps allowed in the center of each side of the cluster. The cluster is also larger than it looks on the website and is a good size. This still worked for me since my girls are wearing strapless dresses

 Crystal and Chain are great This product is excatly as it is advertised. The crystal is a ball shape - and slides nicely onto the chain and catches the light quite nicely. I am not sure that if it was a flat backed item it would do as well. The chain is exactly what I was looking for as I now use it for not just this slide but others as well. The length is great - it is easy to put on (when you have fingernails!) and both have gotten many compliments.

 great ring great price I absolutely love this ring. Big enough to be showy but not obnoxious. The quality is good too. Not heavy enough to swing the stone to the side. I agree with other posts that the blue is lighter in person than in the picture featured online. It resembles more an aquamarine than a standard blue topaz but I for one am not disappointed. A beautiful ring and you can't beat the price.PS The packaging it came in is also very nice

 Just do it! I absolutely love this ring! The blue might be ever so slightly lighter than the picture but not by much and I found the size fit me perfectly. The stone is a very generous size its so large in fact that it works as a cocktail ring and I get tons of compliments when I wear it! I did not have high expectations for the price and I was totally blown away when it arrived. So I ordered the matching necklace as well. It is also a great piece with an identical stone in size and colour and it comes on a nice box chain. If you're thinking of ordering either of these pieces JUST DO IT! You won't regret it.

 disappointed Granted I only spent $22 on this ring and so maybe I should not have had high expectations but I did expect it to last more than one week of normal usage. The prongs of the setting kept catching on clothing and they bent almost immediately the stone became loose and then while I was trying to bend a prong back to secure the stone the prong broke completely off. The prongs on my ring were not nearly so smooth looking as the photos show. It was a very pretty ring but unfortunately

 Good purchase I agree with the reviewer who said this ring is pale. It is not as deep a blue as you would see at a jewlery store or even Walmart (I went there yesterday to compare). However I like it. It is still a pretty blue and large although not large enough to look tacky or anything. The mount is strong and sturdy and holds the stone well. All in all I am glad I purchased this and will continue to wear it with my favorite blue sweater!

 Simple Elegance I love my birthstone and I wanted a piece of jewelry that symbolized the simple purity of the Blue Topaz. This ring did that for me. As a gift to myself for my birthday this year it was definitely a great gift and a welcomed addition to my collection.

 GREAT! Arrived two days early and absolutely what I was looking for. The earrings are small enough not to overwhelm little ears but yet detailed enough for the pirate lover. One of the earrings had a sharp edge to it and I'm not sure if it was just not polished enough but if you order these (and you SHOULD if you have a pirate loving little girl) make sure to check them over a bit.

 Perfect! I bought these for my 5 yr. old daughter to wear when cheering since their mascot is a Pirate. They were the perfect size for her tiny ears! She adored them so much she wouldn't take them out. Unfortunately she lost one at school so I am now having to purchase a second pair to replace them. We both loved them so much it is absolutely worth purchasing twice!

 beautiful earrings Beautiful earrings you can wear them with everything they are just gorgeous! Pearls and brilliants combine perfectly well and illuminates the whole face. The only but is that after a while they are a little uncomfortable. And it is not a problem of weight because they are very light. Perhaps it is the closure system. Anyway

 Nice pendant but bad design I received this as a gift. The stones are a lovely smoky quartz color not a faded out version. The necklace looks very pretty. The problem however is that the loop that the necklace threads through on the pendant is like an oversized 'D'......with the flat part against the pendant and the rounded part against your skin. It's so oversized that it means the pendant cannot lay flat

 Not so great This ended up larger than I was hoping for and still haven't even bothered to wear them.

 Lovely for a Little While My husband gave this to me for Mother's Day when I was pregnant with our first child. It was such a lovely ring and wonderful gift. I have worn it every day all day for nearly 2 years and it still looks great! The picture definitely does not do the stone justice; it's a really pretty shimmery color that picks up and reflects purple blue pink and a hint of yellow. The MOM engraving is tasteful versus tacky. The 2 little diamonds on either side of the topaz are trivial and not really a focal point of the ring. *UPDATE* The main stone fell out when it was about 2.5 years old. Guess it's back to the drawing board

 Terrible customer service.. Awful If you read the add you (at least I was) are led to believe that you were getting more than one bracelet. They charged me $9 for shipping a small two ounce yellow padded envelope with only one inside which was double the price of the bracelet(s)! I tried contacting the company several times and could only leave messages of which no one returned my calls. I went back later and resurched the add and they had changed the price. Oblivious to me they had made a mistake advertising their product and were not going to honor their add. Shame on them!

 A "MUST" Return This 14K Yellow Gold 7 Inch x 3.0 mm Figaro chain bracelet felt like tin and had an unattractive bright yellow shine. It had the type of shine were I felt if the bracelet were larger I could clearly see my face in it. The edges of the bracelet were rough on the skin. So it went back in the box and was returned.

 A gift that is good looking and a good value I gave these earrings as a gift. They are exactly as described. The 6.0-6.5mm size is small yet so is the price.A note about the 14k stems. My wife's ears react badly to many stems however she says these are fine.I read a review about the pearl falling off...I will write a PS if this happens to my wife's earrings.

 Nice little bags I got these to put candies in as party favors. They are quite small so you can fit maybe four almonds inside. The colors are great. The drawstrings are ribbons so they are pretty too. Also great price. As always Amazon's service and shipping were exceptional.

 Perfect for our need. We ordered these bags to use for the dice game Quarriors which involves keeping lots of dice color-coded and separated in groups of five. These little bags gave us a lot of colors to choose from and were sheer so that we could not only match the dice fairly well color-wise but also identify which creature the dice represented without having to open it. They solve one of the biggest issues with that game which is storing the dice pre-sorted. Each of these bags fits 5 dice perfectly. They'd also make good party or wedding favors so long as you don't mind an assorted mix of colors from pastel blue to brown. They're exactly as described

 Beautifull chain but Beware! It may just be my stupidy but a 16" chain is only 8" around once clasped!I bought this for my wife as she needed a longer chain for a pendant she owns. I figured 16 inches should be long enough but alas it's more like an ankle bracelet! It's 16" if you unclasp it and lay it out! Hook it and it won't go around even a childs neck! Lovely chain just watch the measurements!

 What you see is not what you get... Ordered this $60.00 chain. From the picture it looked to be a nice substantial chain to be given to my one year old grandchild. When I received the chain I was extremely disappointed. The chain is ridiculously flimsy and light weight. One yank and it will break. I had planned to purchase two additional chains but have changed my mind for the price to value is just not there.

 Cheap looking Although these are sterling silver they are very light weight so they do not hang well making them look cheap. The strands are linked by very small chains so they don't move/dangle and even get stuck sideways instead of straight down again making them look cheap. Needless to say I returned them. I guess you have to buy the real thing... sigh.

 Nice ring. Before the increase in gold price this ring would have much cheaper. Still the price was not bad at all. It is a thin ring but reasonably sturdy. It adjusts to the size of the toe well. It stays in place wherever desired. I saw rings from other vendors on Amazon. Those rings were not that much different yet the prices were much much higher. Nice ring. I am pleased.

 Beautiful for the price! This is the second thing I've ordered from PalmBeach Jewelry and it's very nice for the price! It's gold plated so it doesn't turn my finger green and it comes in larger sizes (10 for me) so I can wear it on my thumb forefinger or middle finger instead of a &#34;ring&#34; finger. Also in each of my PalmBeach packages I have received a free gift! In this package it was a woven bracelet which my daughter really liked. Okay so it doesn't look completely authentic it does look really good for a $22 ring! I will definitely purchase from them again! Also this purchase was an Amazon Prime purchase and they guarantee free returns in case it doesn't fit. Can't really lose with this one!!

 Not good for pendants I wish I had given more credibility to the negative reviews. Frankly I don't understand how there ecould be so many positive reviews. It's an ok chain - if you want to wear it by itself. But it's not good for pendants as advertised. It remains perfectly stiff and oval shaped when worn - even a large pendant doesn't pull the chain down as a pendant normally does. I'm returning it.

 Excellent Quality Omega Omegas are stiff. That is their characteristic. They are pre-formed to remain round and keep their shape while wearing. These are not fluid chains. Generally they are worn close to the neck and able to support the weight of heavier pendants and enhancers. These are strong chains. Omegas tend not to slide around the neckline. While wearing it's unlikely the back closure will drift to the front of the neck. Pendants and enhancers tend to stay put. This can be thought of as a "silver collar".Often Omegas are 3 or 4mm thick. I was happy to get this one in the 1mm. It fits the bale on most of my pendants. I have a 4mm that will only accommodate large bales.This is an excellent quality Italian omega at a great price. The silver has a nice gleam it's smooth

Strong shiney secure lobster clasp and able to give some extra "lift" to show off the pendant. I ordered thin Omegas such as these so that I could slide the pendants on easily.

 nice gift for a young girl I ordered this necklace for a young girl to hold a little turtle pendant I purchased for her. The pendant has some weight and does come with its own chain but I thought the omega would give this young girl a different but still delicate look. She will be able to use this chain with any pendant she may have or receive in the future. It's a sweet necklace that once she grows out of it can be passed on to one of her younger sisters.

 Great Gift I purchased this Greyhound charm as a gift for a family member who LOVES Greyhounds and she went CRAZY over it. The charm is actually VERY NICE for the money paid. I bought the jewelry for a pre-teen. However it would be suitable for anyone that loves Greyhounds. I was pleasantly surprised when I received the item--there is quite a bit of detail in the piece. It is well-crafted charm especially for the price.

 Blink and it might disappear Buyer beware. Take your left or right hand. Now look at your pinky finger. Go to the tip of your pinky finger. Depending on the size of your hand the tip of your pinky might be larger than this "Italian charm." No charm here. I am not moved.

 No quality control I recieved this as a gift for my birthday and when I opened it I was terribly dissapointed. The earrings have two different prongs. One earring has all three prongs pictured (one of which looks like 'v' as shown) and the other has a different prong at the point of the earring. They are unwearable! The vendor has very poor quality control

 Almost perfect I received this as a present. I absolutely love it but people should know that it is not exactly like the photo of it shown. There are only 2 diamond accents not diamond accents all around the heart like the picture suggests. although it is very hard to tell this unless you are looking closely. Other than that the chain is thin and it is very beautiful I love my gift.

 Wonderful earrings This is a best buy. I have problems finding simple hoop rings in dept stores. Sabrina Silver rings I been wearing for a few years now and I love them. The way I wear my earrings I wear them 24/7365 to bed etc. With this kind of abuse they last at least a year before the clasp eventually gets bent a bit too much and they get loose.

 Good Earring for the Price! I was looking for small sterling silver hoops to wear in the second holes of my ear. They arrived...a bit larger than what I wanted but nevertheless exactly as described! I was hoping they would touch the bottom part of my lobe as they looped around...at no fault to the seller as they are described perfectly in the description I will just have to purchase the "tiny hoops" that Sabrina Silver makes as well. They are very comfortable and will wear them alongside the "tiny hoops" when I receive them. Fast shipping too! Thank you!

 Poor quality I bought 2 pairs of these for my second and third lobe piercings to wear on a daily basis. They were the perfect size however they were surprisingly hard to put in. The clasp was incredibly hard to get into the hole in 2 of the earrings.I've had them for a little under a month now and the silver is turning brown/black on the inside of the hoop in all 4 earrings. You do get what you pay for seeing as they were so inexpensive. These might be good if you plan on taking them out daily. I wouldn't buy them again.

 Not the best If I could go back and not buy these I would. I should have listened to the reviews because they're right! I bought 6 pairs of these for my ears and thought I could put them in my lobe piercings and the other pair in my cartilage. Well I was wrong. The earrings were really hard to get clipped in the back so it took me over an hour to get 4 pairs in and they didn't fit in my cartilage at all. They were however the size I wanted for my ear. Another thing I noticed about a week of wearing them the part that goes into your ear started to change color to an almost black color. Next time I'll listen. A few earrings also un clipped and I almost lost them.

The heart without the bale is about the size of a penny which is just perfect for me since I like dainty jewelry. The rubies and diamonds are pretty and the silver is highly polished with rhodium plating. The chain it came with is also comfortable and all in all it is a lightweight comfortable beautiful necklace and it looks just like it does in the picture online. I am pleased

 Excellent for the price! I bought a pair of these earrings for myself about 5 months ago. They are still in excellent condition despite multiple wearings and I am very pleased with them; the silver is still bright and untarnished. I bought three more pairs to give to relatives this Christmas and they are also delighted with the earrings.The reason I did not give five stars is that the earrings do not look like the picture. Like another reviewer commented the earrings I received are all the darkest purple; there is not the lovely gradation of tones shown in the photo. Furthermore the earrings I received do not have the variation in stone shape shown in the photo. It may be that each pair is different

 purple predicament Yes they are smaller than pictured but my pair of earrings have no variation at all. Pick the darkest of the stones and that is the color I got times six. I guess I shouldn't complain considering the cost but I'd rather pay more and get what is pictured than a cheap copy.

 Lovely Earrings! I purchased these earings as a gift for a friend of mine and she absolutely adores them! She wears them as often as she can! I can't say enough about how simply beautiful and well-made these earrings are. Silverspeck.com is a great supplier of well-made gorgeous natural stone chip jewelry that is affordable and looks great. If you like purple get these earings!

 Amethyst Crystal Chip stones Earrings I love these earrings because it looks good on. It's a very nice amethyst. And together with the amethyst crystal chip necklace and bracelet I purchased separately but as a set it is a very classy combination. It's also very COLD to the skin when you put it on. Precious stones are cold when you touch them.

 Breath Taking! I am so very happy with my Mystic Topaz Pendant. It is so very beautiful and the gemstone so heavy. I felt the chain didn't do it justice so I ordered a nicer one and used the other one with a lighter pendant I had. Even though I thought the chain too lightweight I would never return it because the beauty of the gemstone is so very breathtaking!

 Nice --But Look Different Than Pictured These earrings are cute but they are not what I expected. From the picture it looks like they are almost two-toned. I thought half of the heart would be shiny and the other half would be a darker silver--that's why I bought them. They are actually a solid very shiny silver. They also appear thicker and a bit rounded in the picture but they are actually pretty flat and thin. Very cute and nice but not at all what I thought I was buying. The did arrive in a timely manner and nicely packaged. I'll give them a 4 out of 5 because of the deceptiveness of the picture.

 Reminds Me of Costume Jewelry This is a nice set of earrings for a reasonable price. However on the backside of the earrings the words "Made In Thailand" are stamped in letters large enough to easily read. While the earrings will hang so as to conceal this gaudy stamp most of the time it will become noticeable over the course of the day.This product could have been an exceptional buy but the tasteless stamping on the back of the earring itself makes this reminiscent of a child's play jewelry.

 Solid value I purchased this item as a gift and was greatly relieved when I opened the package to find a substantial product. As we have 'sweater season' I had been worried that the physical strength would not stand up to a cable-knit sweater. This is quite strong and will not bend easily. The loop on the back will accept a 1.5mm chain or a 1.8mm if it has small looped links. Elegantly casual.

 My jewelry looks awesome If you want your jewelry to looks it's best you have to buy one. This is an excellent jewelry cleaner. I have used the unit to clean small and large pieces of jewelry. Ultrasonic cleaning is great for getting into the knooks and crannies of your jewelry that you can't reach. The unit produces 42000 ultrasonic waves per second which is the best you will get unless you buy a professional model which would cost a heck of a lot more. I still take my jewelry to my jeweler every 6 months to be steam cleaned and make sure no stones are loose but this product saves me tons of money in between visits by getting my pieces clean and leaving them beautifully sparkley.UDPATE

 Flashier package but still an amateur device The tank size (which is intentionally omitted from the product description) is too small for large jewelry or sunglasses. To find a real ultrasonic device search the web for "cavitation +ultrasonic jewelry cleaner." This is an amateur ultrasonic cleaner in a "designer" plastic package designed for sale to those who haven't done their homework on ultrasonics.

 Good jewelry cleaner for the price I researched ultrasonic cleaners last year and got this one for my wife. She is VERY happy with it. The other cheaper ones didn't appear to do anything according to the reviews. The professional ones probably work better; however they are also much more expensive. With this one you can see the dirt coming off of the jewelry. It comes with cleaning solution and works better with the solution. My wife reuses the solution until it is really dirty after 1 year she still has 1/2 a bottle left. She uses it for rings necklaces and bracelets.

 Just OK This product was just average due to it's shipping and instructions. This machine is supposed to come with different cleaners and polishing cloth. However they are not shipped together and I had to call back to get the cleaners. The machine is worthless with out them. It took nearly 3 weeks to get all materials necessary to use this product. Additionally the instructions are vague and don't give good direction on how to clean all types of jewelery.

 Go for it! I was also searching for the 'jewlers cleaning sparkle'. This product is worth the money becaause it cleans better than anything else I have tried. I hadn't had my ring professionaly cleaned since I had it resized 2-3 years ago.I added some home cleaner (like Fantastic) to the cleaning solution after not being too impressed with the first 2 cycles. It took about 5 cleaning cycles but my ring looks fantastic.

 Doesn't clean as well as it should I ordered my jewelry cleaner directly from Shaper Image. The unit arrived a few days later but they didn't ship the cleaning solution with it and it took another week for that to arrive. When I finally got everything I was so excited to use the cleaner expecting to get the orginial shine my engagement ring had when my husband gave it to me. I was disappointed. After 2 cleanings (one on normal mode and one on high) the cleaner got the platinum band shiny again and the top of the diamond. However my particular ring has a unique setting that is like a U shape that the diamond sits in. When you hold the ring up at eye level you can actually see the bottom of the diamond. The cleaner did not clean the area under the diamond at all. I can easily get into this area under the diamond with a small brush it is an open space so I thought the solution wouldn't have any issues reaching this area. I was able to clean my ring better with the cheap ammonia based solution that you buy at a drugstore. This machine was a total waste of money for me.UPDATED

 Menorah Pendant I looked everywhere for a menorah pendant until I found this one. It was exactly what I wanted and I have gotten many compliments on it. The back is flat as I expected but the front contains all the details as seen in the picture. The bale is not soldered and it would be nice if it was because it is the perfect size and I wear all the time. With the price of gold going up this is a good value. I am ordering one for a friend who liked mine so much. If the bale was soldered I would give it 5 stars but since it isn't

 Menorah Pendant Beware - this product looks nothing like the picture. There is no detail - just a tiny flat piece of gold and definitely not worth the price and the bale is not even soldered. I sent it back.

 Damaged Merchandise I received this pendant today and a stone was missing. This was my first purchase with Gem Avenue. I cannot believe that I waited about 10 days to get the package and it came damaged. I guess they have a poor quality control department. It was quite obvious that the stone was missing. Maybe someone there is blind as a bat!

 doesn't look like rubies I should have paid attention to the other review. These stones are very light almost pink. I loves the sapphire ones but am really disappointed in these. The diamonds are nice and for the price they are okay earrings. Since they are so inexpensive I won't return them. After I pay shipping again it's not worth it.

 For $3? It meets expectations Got someone who likes turquoise? They'll probably like these chip earrings. I saw from a few other reviews that some people were dissatisfied with the color of the turquoise... I didn't have that problem. I gave these as a gift and the girl liked them; she thought they were probably around $10 so I suppose that's a win for me.I can't comment on how durable they are but they look pretty good when she wears them. They're a bit small probably you only get 5 or 6 chips per earring but they work for a simple accessory. If you want something a bit more elegant (and a bit more expensive) I would recommend these

 Silver stone chip earrings I got this same earring in four colors -- onyx red turquoise and purple (how did I miss the lapis?) They surely are a bargain seem to be well made and match a number of necklaces for which I had no appropriate earrings. They are lighter and more comfortable than some of the extremely expensive earrings I own. I recommend them heartily.

 Horribly thin band beautiful ring otherwise As the previous reviewer stated the band on this ring is just intolerably thin. The first ring I received was so beautiful that I hoped the crumpled band was an aberration so I contacted the company and sent it back for a replacement. They were very courteous and prompt in all communications. Unfortunately the second ring also had a hair-thin band but at least it wasn't already crumpled in the box! I'm afraid to wear it; it's so thin. But it's so beautiful and relatively inexpensive that I decided to keep it

 Feels really big on your tongue but is pretty cool. The Red and White Bullsey Logo Barbell Tongue ring isn't something you want to wear everyday because it makes you feel like you have a fat tongue. By the end of the day you're mostly used to it but it's still a little odd. You can tell by the picture that the bullseye is about twice the size of a normal barbell ball.

 Great Earings These tricolor earrings are just large enough to be noticed small enough to be discrete and go with just about everything. - being vermail makes the color a little briter than gold would be but is an advantage for me. Please note though the leaf in the center of the heart is fixed - it is not a separate dangle inside the heart as it appears to be in the picture.

 Interesting but good It's the first time I odered a tongue ring that had a bigger ball on top and an emblem embedding in it like this (I ordered two). I have to say at first it felt weird but after a few minutes I loved it. AND because the top is like rubber coated over the picture it doesn't bother the top of your mouth or your teeth. It's top heavy to feel but you don't notice it after a few minutes. I like it a lot.

 SIMPLE ELEGANCE I had recently ordered and received a crescent pendant from a TV shopping channel. It was real gem stones and triple the cost but was simply not worthit it in either the look or the quality of the piece. This one definitely is. The pendant appears to be well made the stones are properly set and the chain has an extender which a lot of people like. It's a lovely piece for any one who's a "moon girl" or just wants a believable CZ piece for day or evening.

 Pirates of the Amazonian A pendant I got for my boyfriend's birthday one of a pair I got him so he could change it with his whim although he wears the other pendant more often (the Celtic lovebirds knot) this one is still cool. It is somewhat large so it almost looks like costume jewelry but the sterling silver makes it shine so it looks pretty authentic like a real coin from a shipwreck. If you're into pirates or the shore or flashy jewelry it would be great for you.

 Great gift!! I purchased this U.S.Navy Irish Celtic Cross as a Christmas gift for my 19 year old son. He says that it is his favorite Christmas gift and has been very proudly showing it to family and friends. He is in Naval Officer training and is very excited over the fact that the cross symbolizes his Irish heritage and Christian faith. Product is beautifully detailed and I am very pleased with the seller's customer service. Only drawback is that I wish it came with a chain included. Had to buy my own 24" silver chain.

 like the flame I loved the flame design. I have a few flames on my bike so I wanted this one. My complaint is that the screw ball fastener is plastic and the threads are metal. That'll last about one day with me---I'm too active. I've been known to loose the metal balls but the plastic will probably break first. Maybe they should sell a set of metal balls. But then again the price is right so who cares enjoy it for a while.

 Symbol of my Child I wear this necklace to symbolize my son. He was born in March so his birthstone is AquaMarine. I've been wearing the necklace since I received it in the mail from Amazon and plan to wear it for the rest of my life. I am all about family and I'm very sentimental so things like this mean the world to me.

 Misleading picture... Product's picture was misleading. I thought I was buying a cuban/curb link bracelet. It got delivered promptly in a nice velvet box. But they sent me a cuban squared link bracelet. It looked awful and tacky for my taste. I contacted seller several times trying to simply exchange it for another merchandise. I was told to go online and order replacement piece. It's been showing as not available for 3 weeks. Finally I decided to return product for a refund on 5/02. Todays is 5/14 I already paid my credit card and I haven't seen my money back. Seller never called me to solve issue. By the way because the bracelet cost 5 cents less than the minimum requirement to get "free shipping" status I had to pay for shipping. After I got the product delivered I went online and the very same product was eligible for free shipping. I also had to pay shipping for returning the product. Netaya fooled once. There won't be a second time!!

 Pretty in Picture but very fragile lil sloppy etc. This ring looks very pretty and cute in the photo. However this ring has some flaws... 1) ring is very tiny and thin (more than looks in photo) 2) ring is not a true size 6 (so if buy probably should get 1 size up) and 3) Red enamel is a lil sloppy in person (Idk if every copy of ring is like one I got but mine the red did not stay inside the heart. it bleed over to heart edge n side on some hearts). The positives... 1) it's silver 2)pretty shade of red and 3) If you like hearts this ring is 4 u. So if one is gonna buy just be aware that the ring is very delicate and fragile so you will have to be very careful with it and take very good care of it and want to buy one size up if your fingers are not a small/barely size 6 or big size 5. On a side note I would rate the seller Eve's Addiction MUCH higher than the ring. I give the ring a 3 out of 5 stars and EA 4.8 out of 5 stars.

 A big disappointment. I received this "locket" in the mail yesterday. It is teeny-tiny and gold filled. I believe I paid $55.00 + shipping for a piece of cheesy costume jewelry that used to be available in a Five & Ten store. I was hoping this gift would become an heirloom that she could pass down to her own little girl. I am afraid it is a piece of junk. It would behoove the vender to say in the ad that it is gold filled. The locket is so miniscule that I can't imagine any photo or piece of a photo fitting in it. Quel dommage!!!

 The Photo is Right on Target I like this piece but I don't love it. The photo is very accurate. Both the peridot and amethyst stones are as deep in color as they appear. "In person" the peridot stones are a little deeper than I personally like. I like the style of this necklace and was hoping the peridot stones would be lighter than the photo....that amethyst drop stone in this necklace is a thing of beauty! Peridot comes in many hues some of the best quality peridot is very deep green but it really isn't one of my favorites

 *CAUTION* Swallowed Ball I was lying down to go to sleep when I felt something weird in my mouth. Well it turned out that the top ball from the tongue ring had some how undone itself and fell in my throat. This is not the first time that one of the acrylic tongue rings that I have orderd from this web site have done this. Most of them the ball from the top cracks and it just comes off. It's quite irritating.

The lime quartz is pale and sparkly. Think they would be good for someone not as petite as I am. They stand out from the ear like a little box in their setting.

 Perfect for earring charms. I have become sensitive to all metals except Platinum. Replacing my earring collection with Platinum does not fit into my budget. My solution is to buy Platinum hoops and convert my favorite earrings to earring charms. Sense the charms do not come in contact with my skin the charms can be of almost any metal. These 10mm Platinum hoop earrings hug my ears perfectly. The delicate size does not distract attention from my charms. I am also buying the 17.5mm Platinum hoop earrings for those times I want to put on more than one charm at a time.

 Merely Mediocre The pendant is pretty and it was inexpensive as far as jewelry goes but when the product finally came I was a little disappointed. The stone is skewed in the setting since the right post is thicker than the left. It's not significantly noticeable when viewed from the front though so I didn't mind. Also browse Netaya's website before buying through Amazon. I found a 10k version of the same pendant on sale for less. So if carats don't matter

 Cheap Jewelry This is the 2nd time I purchased from Eve's Addiction and I thought the jewelry was cheap for the amount I paid for it. Their photography is deceiving. I first purchased a bracelet for a present and was very disappointed when i received it. I returned it. I then purchased earrings and antoher pair for Christmas gifts and again disappinted. One of the earrings looked like it had cut cz but when I received it it was just sterling silver with raised dots that appeared in the photo to be cz. I wouldn't buy from them again.

 literally breathtaking! I have had real diamonds and everything in between. These moissanite earrings have more fire and sparkle than my real diamonds - literally took my breath away when I opened the box! In the past the CZ studs I have had got scuffed & scratched and lost that initial sparkle after a few weeks. These moissanite studs have kept every bit of brilliance as they did when I first opened them. The 1.5 carat size I was concerned might be too big and look fake because of the size but they are actually the perfect size. Don't hesitate to buy them - they are a great deal. With moissanite who needs real diamonds?

I am now finding that I think I might like this ring a lot better than my very nice "real" one. The stone is a believable size unlike many CZ rings that I have seen lately and as a set they just look great. I am so pleased with this product. I never write reviews but I just had to for this ring. I would recommend it to any one- even to be used as their one and only wedding ring. It sure would have saved us a boat load of money.

 Absolutely stunning! This ring set is absolutely stunning! And it looks so real! My original wedding set costs $4720.00 and does not even compare to this set. I will wear this one from now on. Everyone keeps commenting on how gorgeous the rings are and how my husband must have spend a fortune. Definitely worth buying!!!

 This ring will turn your finger green I was very pleased with this ring when I first got it in December. Within a couple of weeks it was turning my finger green. I have only had it for a few months and it has become tarnished very quickly despite the fact that I clean it. It is a very beautiful ring so I am a little sad that it is not the quality I was looking for.

 Diamonds too small to see Band too thin. This ring I ordered because I loved their Jessica Simpson replica however it is uncomparable. The main diamond is on the large size however the diamonds all around the wedding band and engagement ring are so tiny you need a magnifying glass to see them. Additionally the wedding band width is SO THIN it is obvious that it is not real. The silver is also too shiny making it look cheap. I did not return the item

 Not worth the money The ring turns your finger green which is quite embarrasing. The cz is loose in its setting and actually makes a small rattling noise. I tried never to get any water on the ring and it still looks dull and has lost it's sparkle after only two months. I know it was less than $50 but I have purchased other cz rings that hold sparkle and shine for years. This set should be priced at around $20

 Nice to look at but it wore out quickly. My husband bought me this ring and it was so very lovely when it arrived. I wore it for a couple of months and received many compliments. Since I rotate my jewelry this was not a daily wear item. That is why I was so disappointed when it started looking dull and the "silver" started to wear off. Even a light buff with a shine cloth did nothing for it and I was afraid to use a cleaner since the color was already coming off. It was beautiful to start with but it did not last long. If I had to guess I had worn it maybe 15 to 20 times. I expect even my costume jewelry to last longer than that.

 Great little bracelet!! Watch the Horses though. This bracelet was purchased for my 7 year old. She really likes it. It has strong cording so that it will not break easily. The one problem that I do find with it is that the horse charms will fall off easily though. I know this is an issue with the charm bracelet itself however I have found a couple possible solutions. Either soder it your self OR buy the really good metal glue. It works really well.Great bracelet very cute..two different types of horses. Would actually rate it ..4 1/2 stars.

 No problems at all This horse bracelet was a gift for my granddaughter a couple of years ago and she cherishes it. A 5 or 6 yr old is too young to appreciate it and chances are they would not take good care of it. As far as I know there has been no problems at all with the horses falling off or I think she would have told me. Its a beautiful bracelet for girls that love horses and are old enough to take care of a piece of jewelry.

 Beautiful and great customer service I bought two of these rings as a symbol of love between my partner and I -- a simple band of white-gold. I was nervous about it because of the sizing but the jewelers were astute and communicated to me the results before resizing them to my specifications.

 A whole lotta bling for a little cha ching!! This ring is unbelievably beautiful...as in it sparkles like diamonds and looks like them..such high quality and I find everytime I wear this set I catch people staring at it or complimenting it. The very first time I wore it I was bartending a wedding and had a guest take my hand and ooh and ahh over it and then go get her huband and had him check it out--it was a test to see if it was a ring that could pass for the real thing and this one truly passes that test. Very comfortable to wear and with the way she shines you will never want to take it off your hand!!

 Surprisingly Nice I just got this and i really like it. The stones are small enough to not give off that cz rainbow thing The setting is a little shiney and light but in time I hope it darkens a little but it is heavier than some semi-precious stone rings I have in the same style. It is a little big but not enough to make me think it's going to fall off and a size smaller would have made it too small. I am going to separate them and wear one at a time but people have different tastes and would be able to wear it as they wish and it would still look nice.

 Just wasn't meant for me They were definitely beautiful as previous reviews stated. The problem is that I must have odd fingers as they were so big they made my middle and pinky fingers stick way out to the side. It was far from comfortable and would have looked awkward to someone else's eyes. I am sending them back. Other than the too-bulky-for-me problem the 2 day shipping was fast. The rings do not look cheap at all but be prepared (in case you are like me) to have the prongs poking you. I even tried just one or two of the rings and it did not look right.

 ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!! Received the three rings in a size 6 a few days ago. They are gorgeous and I have already paired them with a number of my other wide band rings (one on either side of the ring) and they fit beautifully. They also sparkle just like the real thing - they are not too white but very believable. I am very picky about my jewelry and will send something back in a second if I don't instantly fall in love with it. I was so happy with these rings that I just ordered another set in size 5 to wear on my left hand.

 Beautiful ring set This is a lovely ring set. Beautifully made quite heavy (doesn't feel light and cheap) and sparkles nicely. My only observations (not complaints really) would be that the stones in the two stacking rings on either side are much smaller than the middle ring something that is not noticeable in the picture. The second thing is that there is a big "CHINA" stamp inside the ring. If you're fussy about such things then don't get this ring.All in all a lovely ring set and well worth the money for something that you can wear every day that will give your hand added sparkle.

 Very realistic comfortable. I bought this set of three planning to use two to flank a blue eternity band I already had. The size is about half a carat for each ring with a very nice sparkle and shine. This is very realistic looking and they look great toghether. Because the stones are not too large they fit quite comfortably. Highly recommended!

 Great Value for Ring guards Purchased these as ring guards. I use 2 of them to "oopmh" up my solitaire and I use the third to stack with other stack rings. What a great value for multiple uses!

 Center ring IS different from guard rings I never expected these rings to be so nice. I really like this set.No missing stones everything seems secureI'm not sure if I saw it in any of the other reviews and it was for sure not mentioned in the item description and does not seem obvious in the photo but two of the rings have smaller stones than the third ring... It is very noticable once you look at the interior side of the rings.The larger stoned ring is put in the center and it does not really interlock with the side rings at all but it still looks great. Just thought that it would have been nice to know beforehand that it was not three identical stacking rings. I would actually call it an eternity ring with two guard rings instead of a matched stack.Also I think these rings run a little small?... my right hand fingers are larger than my left hand. I ordered the regular size I always wear for my right hand and this stack is a bit tight but it fits perfectly on my left hand.But it is a beautiful ring with lots of possibilities... love it so far

 scollins Love these rings. Came quickly & flawless. One does have stones just a little bigger than the other two. I put the two that matched on either side of my engagement ring and they all look gorgeous together. I have small hands and still all three rings on are comfortable. I can also wear all three of these bands together on my wedding ring finger to switch it up if I want a change. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants something that looks real and expensive without spending the "real" money. Someone actually thought they were real today so they passed the test. I have done everything I normally would with them on...shower lotion work dishes. So far no issues.

 I love these rings I love this three-piece ring set. It arrived about three days after I ordered it and I have not stopped wearing the set yet. I love the sparkle and I have not found them to be uncomfortable to wear together as some stated. Also all three bands are the same size and look realistic. It is nearly two months and I am still enjoying the sparkle on my finger. I love the set so much that I am buying a set for my sister to enjoy as well.

 Awesome!! soooo worth buying! This ring is the bomb!!! I was lookin for something pretty I could wear everyday. My wedding band set is very expensive so I did not want to overuse it. I got this ring because it looks soooo much like my original wedding band and matches my eng ring. When I received the package (within 3 days) I was shocked how similar it looks. The cz is a great copy of the diamonds! I swear you cannot tell the difference unless u have it 1 inch from your eye and u stear at it for a while. I even wear this ring with my eng ring which has real diamonds and you really can't tell the difference. The only difference is th metal my eng ring is 14k white gold which is obviously darker than this sterling silver. Anyhow I'm very picky about my jewelery and I love the real stuff but i do not mind wearing this at all!! Too bad they dont have half sizes i'm 5.5 in ring size so I got the 6 and its a little loose.

 Perfect Love these rings. Using two of them as ring guards for a man's ring that's very special to me but was way too big. I didn't want to get the man's ring sized so wanted two "ring guards". Looks classy and small enough stones to look like the real thing! Great great purchase!

 Love this Ring I just love this ring. It is so versatile. I had a set of enamel rings that needed a little something added to them to give them a spark of beauty. Anything I had looked at was at least $20 and I would have to order two of them to be able to wear the rings in a couple different ways. When I saw this set of rings I was excited to think of the many ways I could wear them and at a price that I would not be afraid to wear them. So glad I did. I've worn just one or all three with my enamel rings and with plain bands. These rings shine nicely and feel great. My favorite way to wear them is one by itself a nice classy look. They are made very well I don't worry about a stone falling out of them.

 Awesome I bought this item as a test to determine if I wanted an eternity band as I heard they were uncomfortable and I did not want to spend alot of money for something I did not like. I LOVE this ring and I plan on wearing it for a long time. It's actually three rings so if you feel like wearing just one band you can and it is very pretty. It looks expensive and I have had numerous comments from people regarding how pretty it is and when I tell them how much it cost they are shocked. Well worth the money and I received it very quickly

 Ring sizes do not match! Although these are suppose to be stackable they do not line up well and contains 2 smaller bands - in ring size and CZ size. The prongs on the bands are very uncomfortable and sharp and will take some getting used to. Other than the size issues I would not have returned them if the rings and CZ were all the same size.

 PDanish I have been wearing these rings for about a month now and I am very impressed. The problem with other rings I have purchased like these has always been the fact that the stones have fallen out within the first week of wearing them. I have NOT lost any stones and these rings have been a great substitute for my gold rings. I have been very pleased so far.....

 They sparkle.... and good value. The rings are about half a size bigger than the actual size you think you're ordering. Yes one ring is bigger than the other two but I like the set better that way and I would've preferred if they were all the size of the larger one. They are a little wide so it takes some getting used to but they are not rough as some have stated. I like them and I pair them with my engagement ring. The silver looks like platinum to me.

 Great for the right hand Thanks to all the reviewers of this product. I'm blind and rely quite heavily on customer reviews.I've been wearing these rings constantly for about a week now and find them quite comfortable. As previous reviews have stated they are a little thick and the stones a little rough. I got used to it rather quickly though.I wanted something pretty for my right hand that I didn't have to remember to remove constantly. I use my hands to "see" so I'm picky about rings. So far they haven't gotten caught on anything or been a hindrance. The only time I've really noticed them is while washing my hands; if washing too vigourously you'll feel those stones. Also I remove when washing or styling hair as they pull a little.The inside of the ring is smooth and comfortable and I can't wait to experiment paring one or two of them with other silver rings. For the price you can't pass up these rings. I'll let the other reviews speak to their beauty

 LOVELY !!! I ordered this set of 3 cz stack rings to mix and match with other rings. They are gorgeous solid silver with very nice bright cz's unlike some much more expensive ones I have ordered in the past from a very expensive on-line store which I promptly sent back. These little rings are quite dazzling and look lovely worn together or used as guard rings each side of just about any ring you already own. At just over $10 for each ring they are a steal.

 beautiful bands! The rings are beautiful and they aren't uncomfortable. They fit perfectly too! They arrived in a small pouch inside a blue box. The blue box was well packed by amazon in a bigger box with air-filled bags for protection. It also arrived fast!I was concerned with what someone wrote about one ring being bigger than the others... the actual true is that the stones are bigger on one ring but the three rings are the same size. I wear that one in the middle and it looks nice.

 Great Value My fiancee and I bought this ring set as a wedding band - we spent a lot on the engagement ring so we decided to go cheap on the wedding band. This fit the bill perfectly - although it is not real diamond it compliments the real ring well. We liked that we got three rings for this price so that we could choose between the slightly-larger or one of the smaller bands (we chose the smaller) and we now have a replacement band in case it gets lost. The only complaint I've heard from her is that after washing her hands she gets bubbles and popping noises from the ring due to the holes on the inside of the band. For the price

 Pretty but Definitely Does not Look Real I was really excited to receive these rings. I really wanted to love them but I have to agree with the poster who said there is just something about them that makes them look fake and "Made in China" as stamped on the inside. I can't pinpoint it exactly either. This is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. By looking at the metal there is no way these would hold up to daily wear as wedding/anniversary bands. It almost looks like tin foil and I can tell if would start flaking. I am sure though the designer didn't necessarily intend these to be worn as every day rings.Would be fun wear to a party or on the right hand but I put 2 of these on either side of my wedding band and engagement ring and it was laughable how fake they looked next to the real deal. My setting is in platinum so that might not help but even if someone has white gold these are not going to match.As far as costume jewelry or something sparkly to wear on the right hand these are cute little rings. In that regard they should get a 5 star.

 Loved it at first but just too uncomfortable! It sparkles and looks nice. I absolutely LOVE thicker bands so when I saw this I had to try it. I loved having the option to wear all 3 or just 1. I wore it for a week then decided this had to go back. As much as I liked this it was just too uncomfortable. The prongs stick out a lot and goes all the way around. It pokes the sides of the fingers next to it. I tried to deal with the discomfort but by the 5th or 6th day I was soo ready to return it. Maybe this will work for someone who had really thin fingers but it was just too uncomfortable for me.

 GORGEOUS! Look like the real thing!!! I wanted two rings to guard my wedding ring. I spent $600 on a ring that could not be sized so I thought why not try a CZ ring in the meantime to see if I liked having my wedding ring with two bands. Boy I'm so glad I came across these beauties! They are not too white. They sparkle like crazy. They match my real diamond ring. They are set so wonderfully and look wonderful! Do not hesitate to buy them. Sizing is perfect. I'm a true size 8 and they are so comfortable. They are a little wider due to the fact each CZ has its own setting - which looks great! They are very comfortable and I wear them everyday. Do not even think twice about these rings. I want to order another set just to have a back up in case anything happens to these rings. People have commented how wonderful they look. I'm so surprised how much they look real. Fast shipping and I couldn't be happier! Thank you!!!! You saved me $550!!!!

 Its pretty but.... When I received this ring the first thing I noticed was the stones are all different sizes. For each individual band the stones match but the three rings themselves don't match. Also one band is slightly bent and doesn't sit flat against the others. But the stones have lots of sparkle and I had planned on using two of them for either side of my gold wedding band which they work perfectly for. All in all for the price its a good value.

 Great Ring The rings are great. I wear two of them with my three stone ring in the middle and it is so sparkling and then I wear a blue stack eternity ring in the middle which looks very rich and yet simplistic at the same time. Even with all three rings on the finger is still very comfortable. I have had people comment on the ring about how it sparkles and where did I get it?

 The perfect mate to my engagement ring! I just received this great trio set. I was looking for something to replace my original wedding band that had lost diamonds. We really had no desire to buy a "real" one again at this point. I looked on Amazon for weeks and found this beauty!!I used the outer two to flank my engagement ring. They are the perfect size. Not too small thus making it hard to see nor to big making it look fake and gaudy.I don't find them uncomfortable either. Very realistic looking!I've also added pictures of my flanked rings to their photo gallery!

 Looks like costume jewelry....FAKE I was looking for a replacement wedding band not too expensive because I recently lost my real wedding band (so sad)! This ring is far from "real" looking. Its very sparkly but its just something about it that looks unreal...hard to explain. I hate to return things but I am returning this ring. This ring is good to compliment other costume type jewelry but will never pass for "real".

 Size Change While I agree with everyone else that it's a beautiful ring set and that you can't tell their not real I noticed that after a month or 2 they went from fitting perfectly to becoming a little big/loose on my finger...Maybe it's just me and my set of rings or someting...I can still wear them it's just not as perfect a fit as before...Certinly not something to send in and get a different size...

 Beautiful! These bands look like the real thing..very well made with lots of sparkle! I normally wear a 7 1/2 and ordered a 7 and they fit perfect. Because my fingers aren't really long can only wear 2 at a time to be comfortable but 3 will work. They're fun to put with other rings or just wear alone so glad I ordered them. For the price you can't go wrong!

I wanted them as an alternative to wearing my real wedding set all the time especially in the summer when i am at the pool or the beach. The price of these rings was just too good to pass up. They arrived quickly and i was soo happy with my purchase. They are beautiful and worth every penny. if you want them BUY THEM!!! you will not be dissappointed!!!!!!

 Stacking Eternity Bands I purchased this item just because it was cheap and I've always wanted an eternity band but didn't want to INVEST and reading the other's reviews I ordered this one. It is VERY nice does not look like a cheap imitation. I compared it to my girlfriends real diamond eternity band and you cannot tell the difference. The bands are not exactly matched up but I don't have a problem with that I wear only two of the bands at a time due to my short fingers. Great item and great price!

 Gorgeous This set is gorgeous! Looks very real and is very comfortable to wear. I replaced this ring with a real wedding ring and since I cannot wear a size 5 on my right hand I purchased the same ring in a size 6! I gave the old set to my best friend. Anyway the ring is perfect to use as a wedding set or on your right hand to compliment your jewelry!

 lovely rings! I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Ordered these rings in a size 7 after carefully reading all the reviews. They're beautifully made with a nice sparkle and so elegant! I didn't find them to be uncomfortable at all. The stones on one of the bands are slightly bigger than the stones on the other two; this doesn't bother me as I don't think it's noticeable. 2 day shipping - always a plus! Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase and would recommend the product.

 I love it! I really love this. I did not find it too thick- and it is very comfortable. I have large fingers so it does not push my fingers apart- but I think if you were petite it might be uncomfortable especially if you had thin fingers. It does look like diamonds. I've had a lot of compliments and I wore it with a real diamond bracelet and no one could tell the difference between the ring and the bracelet. We were out at a restaurant and the lighting wasn't super bright

 versatile but... The rings are pretty but as a few other people mentioned not the most comfortable. I like the fact that you can wear one or all three the only problem while wearing all three is there's gaps between the rings (they don't stack tightly) and seem to come apart. For this reason I prefer to wear one on my thumb looks cool and keeps the ring from rubbing on the other fingers. I cannot imagine wearing these on a middle finger ouch. They are well made (hence the 4 stars) and hopefully the little CZ's won't fall out as they have done in other rings I've purchased elsewhere and had to return.

 pretty but painful I returned these rings after wearing them for one full day. They look pretty but have sharp poking edges all around the sides from the stones and their settings. Washing and drying my hands was so uncomfortable because of the rough feeling these rings had. I actually had 2 cuts on my middle finger from where it had pressed against the rings on my ring finger. I was disappointed but had to return them. Its just not worth the pain!

 Nice ring This ring is beautiful and it can be separated as one individual ring. My finger is small  so it'd good that I could wear only 2 rings. The Zirconias size are not so big so it can convince people better that way. If you look for something simple and comfy this is the ring that you are looking for.

 Very nice This is a very pretty eternity band. The stones seem to be well set. As others have mentioned one of the bands has bigger sized stones. I guess it's not so bad since it adds a little flair but the picture provided by Amazon is not accurate. Others have also mentioned how uncomfortable the ring is and that it pokes on the sides of their fingers. I have skinny/bony fingers and I do not experience any uncomfortableness with these rings. There is a bit of a gap between each ring but that's because one band has larger stones. Overall I like them. They are shiny!

 Beautiful high quality! I bought these stacking bands to wear in place of my engagement ring and wedding band for vacations and at the beach. I am used to my wedding set which is absolutely stunning and full of sparkle so i wasn't sure how I'd feel about wearing tiny cubic zirconiums. At least I wanted to get sterling silver so this "vacation set" would not turn my skin green over time. Well let me tell you - I am pleasantly surprised! These bands SPARKLE! To the untrained eye

 built to last Bought these rings for my soon to be wife for christmas. I thought they looked good online and were of an appropriate size to be noticable without being so large people would assume them to be fake. When i recieved the rings i was very impressed. It has now been almost five months and i could not be more pleased. My girlfriend never takes the rings off and they have not lost any luster through countless showers swimming in pools and the ocean and the beating they take keeping up with her active lifestyle. Great buy very durable and a steal at such a low price.

 LET THE BLING WARS BEGIN!!! These rings are beautiful and do they look like the real thing! I flanked my plain gold band with two of these sparkly trinkets and I swear they totally hold their own with the girls at work flashing their diamonds which they claim cost thousands! When I see how beautiful my new sparklers are and know I paid less than $30 I wonder if somebody ain't lying! Anyway I'm passing mine off as the GOODS and unless Marie asks me straight out if they are real(and if she does I'm gonna ask her if her uppers are real)

The 3 rings are not attached - so i take 2 and wear them w/ my diamond when i want a little extra bling bling and they totally look real!!!! I also use all 3 together when i don't wear my diamond doing things like working out or swimming or traveling!!! It's well worth the $25 or whatever i spent on it!

 Just Lovelerly!!! Wow how lovely these rings are. With the low price I wasn't sure I would get anything worth wearing and boy was I pleasantly suprised when I slipped them out of their little black pouch. They are beautifully made look exquisite together and sparkle just like diamonds. As a matter of fact I held them next to my diamond dinner ring and unless you're a jeweler I don't believe you could tell the difference. I'm going to wear them together or combined with another ring I just bought from amazon that is also amazing. Each band is identical to the other and they are easy to wear. I am so delighted with this purchase I'm going to tell all my friends where they can find them.

 It's just okay. I bought this ring(s) hoping to love it but it was *okay*. Maybe because I do own real diamonds my eye is a bit to keen. I felt like it looked fake.

 Sparkly and pretty for the price These rings are very nice. I wouldn't say they look real but they are very pretty. I originally bought this to wear one at a time as an anniversary band behind my wedding set but right next to the real thing you can really tell that this isn't real. So I wear them on my right hand and they look great. One thing I have noticed is that these rings are very hard to clean because it's impossible to get a brush in behind all the little stones.

 Nice Pendant but.... This is a nice pendant but could use a different cord/chain. I bought this for my 15-yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it. However the cord that came with it was coiled and could not be straightened or stretched. I did not contact them about this. We ended up getting her a chain to wear with the pendant. She wears it often. The turquoise color is beautiful. Fast shipping.

 Great...mostly Well it's a great necklace and it's one of my favorites but the paint rubs off of the pick a little after awhile. But considering I've had it for a year and you can still see most of the gold print it's a pretty good deal... the string that holds it on... not so much. It fell off and broke after three months but that was probably because I was obsessing over it and wore it every day. I would not consider pulling on it

 "Man"gagement Ring When we got engaged the future hubby wanted a ring to wear of his own. We looked a lot of places and decided on this one - when I contacted the company they were quick to respond and allowed us to customize our order through amazon.

 Beautiful piece ! This is a gorgeous necklace and looks so much more expensive than what it cost me. I've worn it with pastels and deeper gem colors as well and it looked equally fabulous with both. Very comfortable to wear and lays perfectly on the neck. Lovely colors and looks so much prettier in person than on the screen.

 found my own backs Love love love these earrings. Style was just as I was anticipating. Had to knock off a star though because I really think they should come with rubber backs like many hook earrings do. I use a set of rubber backs from another pair that fit snug on the thread. This ensures I'm not going to loose one and that they both stay at the same length. Craftmanship is excellent. Threading is easy.

 Pretty I ordered this jewelry box as a gift for a girl that will be turning 6. I took it out just to test it and make sure it works fine. The music worked wellit was not too loud but not too soft either. However the swan lake tune played way too fast. I don't know if it was maybe just overwound or it was just made like that. It is different from the speed of the music of another music box we have that also plays swan lake. Anyway other than that the box is very pretty. The top picture is beautiful the colors are pretty. One thing that I did not like is the fact that the paper covering the box is not a perfect cutout and at the side of the box it is smaller than the box. I don't know if all boxes are like that but it is not a big deal. It still looks good. I would recommend this box overall.

 jewelry box Our 5 year old granddaughter loved the jewelry box. It is durable. The ballerina turns if the music isn't wound down and will turn in the box. If you buy it be aware of this. It isn't an issue as they usually let the music play out anyway.The box is pretty and she loved it....it even survived her two year old brother grabbing for the ballerina....great gift for her.

 disappointed Upon receiving the music box and opening it I discovered that the mirror inside was mounted extremely crooked so much so that I had to take it apart (which entailed cutting the material inside) realign it and glue it back together. After doing that it was fine but I knew what work I had done on it even though the recipient had no clue. It was very disappointing

To me it wasnt worth the hassle to rebox the item and take to post office to have it shipped back. I guess I would of preferred they just sent me a new one.

 This is not a toy. It's a jewelry box. I bought this jewelry box for my teen sister. After searching thru many "pretty" and "girly" boxes I settled on this shiny box because its similar to the ballerina one I received on my 15th birthday. This pretty musical jewelry box is worth the tiresome search. She loved the dainty prettiness of the box and the Swan Lake song! Mind you this is a Slipknot and Avenge Sevenfold fan!!The box is made of cheap materials but it was made with great care and precision. It's a cute little jewelry box/large trinket box and the mirror rotating fairy and song are what I expected for the price.

 Little girl fun! Every little girl should have one of these at least once in life! The little fairy/ballerina spinning around to the tinny music is a memory they carry for life. This was bought for a five year old but she is probably a little young for it. My guess is this is a fantastic gift for a six to ten year old. Every time I have given one they didn't already have one and it was a very unique gift.

 Nice Jewelry Box However has flaws Nice jewelry box. It is a more silver than purple color. Very pretty design on the jewelry box. However the box has a dent mark on the top that is pretty obvious a dent in the side not as obvious. The mirror had a nick on the side as well. The box is was packaged in was a clear light weight plastic box that had a rip on one corner. This was a gift for my niece so I had to tape the corner so I could wrap it nicely. She turned 5 and I felt this was a nice gift for her despite the flaws. If she was any older I may think twice about it.

 A little girl's dream gift Our 7 year old granddaughter has dreamed for a long time about owning just such a jewelry box as the Schylling Iridescent Fairy Jewelry Box. When she opened the box and saw the sweet ballerina and heard the delicate tingling music the huge smile and glowing face told us even before she spoke a word of delight and thanks how much she loved her gift. We'd purchased a pair of earrings to place inside which added to the whole effect as well as reenforcing that the box was not just beautiful and fun but practical as well.

 Satisfied with this product I like the earring stand but it is really best for stud earrings and small ones at that. The holes are very close together so anything larger than a stud has to be spaced every other hole and larger earrings even farther than that. But I like the quality and the looks of it.

 Best earring holder ever! My husband uses his all the time! I gave this plexiglass earring/necklace jewelry case to my husband for Xmas and he just loved it. The earrings he wears fit great and don't get caught when it rotates around. If you have dangly earrings I'd recommend standing it upright. It's the novelty of it that makes it so darn cute! It's in the bathroom on the cabinet and having the clear lid lets them show up as well as protect them. We cannot say enough about this earring stand. We didn't want an earring "tree" for him so when I saw this online I knew it would be perfect...and it is! Thanks so much for offering this online!

 Revolving Earring Holder This is a great product because you can view and select your earrings easily. I like that the fact that there is a hinged door to keep the dust out. Unless you only wear posts if you use this in the upright position you will not be able to use all of the holes allotted for storing the earrings. I mostly wear wires so I have to skip a hole in between each pair. If I get a few more pairs of earrings I will have to buy another one but the price is right for the convenience.

 Functional and just the right size As others have said great for short earrings 1" and under not so much for chandelier types. Works fine standing on its end makes it easy to find what you're looking for. Some styles that have the rigid clasps don't fit or drape well but as long as you only have a few of those it works just fine. I'd recommend it.

 Quality product First of all this is an attractive and quality product. I think it works best for stud earrings rather than dangling. To hold studs you can stack more than one unit. Otherwise you will probably want to stand it on end as shown. I would use a harp-style holder for dangling earrings. This unit is easy to use and compact.

 Not for hoops Probably seemed like a good idea to someone but it totally does not work if you have hoop earrings....which I do and quite a few pairs at that ranging in size from small to 3.5" in diameter. Look again there is no way these will fit in this design. My long dangly earrings don't fare too well either as the rows are too close together so long earrings overlap onto those below; also if you have spring ear wire types (french wires?) they are almost impossible to put onto this.

The picture was very small and no size of any of the earrings was given so I was left to guess as to the size. It turns out they are all waaay too big for what I was looking for and I feel stuck with them because it will cost me more money to return them.

 Nice start out or addition to your earring collection. These earrings are perfectly sized from small to large. I got the black and white set. They're really pretty with short or long hair. The only reason I am leaving a 4 star instead of 5 is because they do bend a bit and you have to be a little more careful also some of the color coating comes off so you really have to be aware of how you take care of them. I have black hair so the black ones don't really show through my hair while the white ones are very stark. I wear the white ones with my hair down and the black ones with it up so I always have a pair no matter how I have my hair done. I really liked that they have so many sizes it added a nice start to my hoop collection. I always have a set in!

 Great Product These trays are an extremely economical and convenient way to store your jewelry. Each piece has its own seperate compartment so your jewelry is always easy to find and does not end up in a massive tangled blob of earrings chains and bracelets (you know what I'm talking about). The trays come in many different configurations to hold peices of different sizes and shapes. They definetely aren't fancy but they are decent looking enough to leave on a dresser. I am thrilled I've found these little treasures! A simple solution to a very common and annoying problem.

 Terrific Item These trays are invaluable for anyone who wants to keep their jewelry properly stored and easily available. They allow you to get rid of all of the boxes that accompanied the pieces of jewelry (which take up more space) and have the advantage of making the pieces instantly viewable. They are the only trays that I know of that come with a cover to keep dust away from your jewelry pieces; they are also stackable. They are worthy of the highest praise.

I found the exact items at Bed Bath and Beyond priced from 6.99-9.99. Needless to say I was really pissed off. I did not return because I had unpacked and already placed my jewerly away. However I purchased four other compartments and I paid 9.99/ea. at BBB.

 I can finally see my jewelry! I've had my jewelry in boxes as far back as I can remember and is the reason why most of them never got worn. It was always a hassle to have to sift through them with much of the necklaces being tangled. This completely solves this problem. Velvet fabric is a nice touch as it's color is rich and makes the pieces stand out. The compartments are nicely sized some smaller than others for more dainty pieces. I did mark it down one star for it's very flimsy top cover but at least it came with one. Would have preferred a more solid plastic for added stacking stability

 Excellent but could be better Since this is stackable it would be helpful if the lid sealed. Right now the "lid" is actually a loose cover that easily slides off. Also I have necklaces and earrings that match - this container doesn't lend itself to putting them together. It would be great if the manufacturer had long rows for the necklaces with little boxes at the ends for earrings. However it has a tarnish-resistant lining

 NOT real enamel! This is listed as "enamel". Well it isn't. It's some sort of plastic coating on the inner ring. Real enamel is glass and it's quite durable. I washed my hands with this ring on - just regular soap - and it took the gloss off the ring. Pathetic! I should have known better than to pay this much! I won't be fooled again...I hope.

That's being kind...The stones were about to fall out the setting was very very uneven and what really bothered me more than anything else is that included in the package there's the signature of the person who claimed to have verified the quality or integrity of the product before packaging...I don't know what word would qualify to describe such a person because this was just an insult to me as a customer.I would never ever purchase anything from them or their affiliates again. They do not even include a return sticker as most of their competitors. Please do not waste your hard earned money!!!

 Everyone loves it! I got this pendant for my girlfriend and she loved it. It looks great on her and although it is a very unique piece she is asked by her friends where they can get one. She had a hard time giving them the source because she wanted to be the only one to have it but her friends are pretty persistent. She has not worn it with a scented cloth as it was intended but it looks very nice as it is. No need to put anything in it.I highly recommend this piece

 Gorgeous!! These earrings while small (1.5") are absolutely beautiful! I had my doubts based on the inexpensive price but I am more than pleased! The amethysts are beautiful (true to the color in the picture) and the earrings overall are well made and look much more expensive than they really are. Only one small problem one of the earrings is slightly defective

 looks nice not the best quality. The ring actually looks nice but the picture is a little misleading. The whole back of the ring is hollow. Overall the ring weighs about as much as a ring that you would get in a quarter machine. I can't see how the price can be anywhere over 200 dollars. I'm considering returning this.

 Bad choice Bought these earrings along with another pair from another vendor. They arrived about 5 days later than the other pair. NOW - the "aquamarine" ball on the hoop has fallen off. Nowhere to be found which brings up another point. You can hardly see the "small disc ball" - so when they say small they mean small. About half the size of an eraser on a pencil. Now - the ball has gone AWOL. don't waste your time with these.As an update - I have yet to be contacted by the seller to even offer a refund on these earrings.So "Buyer Beware"

 Dragonfly Bracelet This is absolutely stunning. Heavy well made sterling silver charm on a thick chain bracelet that is not going to come off easily. The pave sparkles to beat the band out in the sunlight. I wear it often without fear of losing the charm. Great company and quick delivery.

 copper temptation not tempting.... This bracelet should never have been packaged and shipped...it was stretched too far out of shape for wear and simply slid off my wrist over my hand to the floor.

 Great Buy! I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my teenage nephew who plays a guitar and is aspiring to be in a rock band. This was perfect for him and he totally loves it and pretty much wears it everyday. I think a leather cord would make a better and stronger holder for the pendant as this one seems a little flimsy. Overall a great piece at a great price.

 Too small for anyone's liking. I'd like to say first of all that I have bought from Dan's Jewelers multiple times and I am a huge fan of their work and craftsmanship. And really I have no problem with the craftsmanship here. The pendant is well-made cool looking and the cord is reliable. My only grief with this particular item is that it's so damn small and it absolutely looks terrible being so little. There's a lot of detail in this necklace and I think that the pendant should be much larger to show that detail.

 Quality not what I expected These look nice however I had to send them back the first time because they were scratched. When I received the second pair one of the clasps was damaged. I was able to fix it so it was usable since at that point I needed a nice pair of earrings for my wedding rehearsal dinner and did not have time to send them back AGAIN! The company did offer to replace them again. I will definitely look elsewhere next time.

 Decent pair of earrings These earrings are decent. I was not overly impressed with them but I have worn them a few times and am fairly satisfied with their appearance from a reasonable distance.

 Not at all what I expected...very disappointed I'll have to say Something Silver does ship quickly but that's about the only good thing I can say. When this necklace arrived I was extremely disappointed. The necklace is cheap and thin as was the charm and the pathetic little stones. Something Silver didn't even put it in a decent little box. I bought this to give to my sister as a Christmas present...I honestly would be embarrassed to give this to anybody. I sent it back to Something Silver the day after I received it. I like some of their designs on other jewelry but definitely question the quality. I doubt I ever order anything from them again.

 Shipping was way too slow but the charm is really nice! I ordered my pendant from David's Jewelers but this is the same one. The pendant I recieved was proportionate to what a pendant size in relation to a chain should look like. It looks good with my 3.0 mm 24 inch chain. Unless you are giving the 1/2 inch size to a baby small child or as a charm for a bracelet don't bother ordering that one. Shipping took a very long time but customer service was top notch and the end product was worth the wait.

I bought this as a Christmas gift.Well after about 5-6 of wearing it we noticed it had tarnished terribly on the side that was against his skin.

 Too small!!! After recieving the product 3 and a half weeks later I found the 1/2 inch pendant was ridiculously tiny for the price. Like "tiny" for a charm bracelet "tiny". However I contacted the seller who immediately exchanged my purchase for a larger version at no additional charge. The pendant I recieved was the 3/4 inch and it is proportionate to what a pendant size in relation to a chain should look like. I'm much happier with the 3/4 inch pendant and it looks good with my 3.0 mm 24 inch chain! In other words unless you are giving the 1/2 inch size to a baby small child or as a charm for a bracelet

 --- 5 Year review --- Still a great ring after stone replacement It is a very nice looking opal ring that is not too small or too gaudy. I like the fillagree style and colorful stone. The diamonds are too small to really make a fuss over but does give a nice sparkle touch.I ended up getting a full size too large which may have helped me because the band is really thin and making it smaller I beleive thickened it.Overall I am very pleased the jeweler complimented on it and I dont think he would have guessed it was at this price.--- 5 year review ----The ring is still worn from my then girlfriend to my now wife whis was only a birthday ring at the time and she still wears it. The gold has held up very well

 Colorful opal This ring gets mixed review from me. The opal does have nice color and seems to be of decent quality. The filligree is nice and adds to the visual appeal. As noted by other reviewers the diamonds are small but nicely frame the opal. Unlike another review the band on the ring I got wasn't thin and seems to be nice. I was a bit disappointed in the size of the opal/set. The ad made it look bigger. It is still a pretty ring but expected a bit larger stone.

 loved but defective I love this ring and have been wearing one for almost a decade this is the thrid one i've purchased all drom different vendors. So when my last one broke i was pretty thrilled to find another one so easily. But i have to say that the dealer hasn't been very responsive. Just two days after getting the ring the liquid started to drip out and now it's completely dry. I've emailed Carolyn but she never responded about replacing this defective product. So buy this ring from another vendor.

 loved but defective I love this ring and have been wearing one for almost a decade this is the thrid one i've purchased all drom different vendors. So when my last one broke i was pretty thrilled to find another one so easily. But i have to say that the dealer hasn't been very responsive. Just two days after getting the ring the liquid started to drip out and now it's completely dry. I've emailed Carolyn but she never responded about replacing this defective product. So buy this ring from another vendor.

 looks nice not the best quality. The ring actually looks nice but the picture is a little misleading. The whole back of the ring is hollow. Overall the ring weighs about as much as a ring that you would get in a quarter machine. I can't see how the price can be anywhere over 200 dollars. I'm considering returning this.

 magnetic bracelet The bracelet was very attractive well made and was described fairly accurately. But I did feel a little misled. I was expecting a bracelet with magnets in the links however only the clasp was magnetic. It was a nice item just not what I had anticipated. It would have been better if it had been described as having a magnetic clasp not as a magnetic bracelet.

 Very nice ring! I was looking for a yellow rose ring as they are my favorite type of flower and this popped right up! Delivery was quick and painless. The ring is true to size and is very cute when worn. Can't speak as to the durability of the gold plate since I don't wear it every day but there haven't been any nicks or scratches so far. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because whoever took the picture is perhaps a bit TOO good at photography! I thought the stone would be more yellow gold based on the photo but its a more subtle color than that. I suppose it really is the color of champagne!

 Nice pendant very delicate chain poor quality c clasp. I purchased the yellow gold version of this item as a Christmas gift for my wife. I was very pleased with the look of the horseshoe pendant but the chain looked very delicate to me. This morning less than 2 weeks since Christmas my wife went to put it on & the c ring clasp broke. We took it to a jeweler to have a new clasp put on. I was not very happy but at least it broke when she was putting it on & not while she was wearing it. I also paid considerably more than the current advertised price. I would have expected a much better quality chain & clasp.

 I love this necklace! I get more compliments on this necklace than any other I own. It is very unique and goes with dressy and casual clothes. The only problem is that because it is such a good price it doesn't last very long. I've had mine for about a year or so and one of the beads is wearing the finish off. But even with that flaw I still love this necklace! It's totally worth every penny.

 These earrings are lovely I was looking for some citrine earrings on the Amazon website and was taken by these. I would disagree with the description of them on the Amazon site - "cute" does not characterize the elegance of these earrings. The citrine and freshwater pearl work well together. I was surprised when I opened the package - these earrings are larger than the impression one gets from the picture. And they are substantial. My suggestion is that you obtain some washer-style backs to keep the earrings up on the ear lobe (they are a bit weighty and tend to fall forward - at least on me). I wore them for the first time at work (at a well known cosmetics corporation) and got loads of compliments. The #1 compliment was "They're so glamorous." They certainly are.

 Not quite as depicted. I found this ring to be a little disappointing in person. The quality is good and the weight is OK but not as heavy as a solid S/S ring due to the spinner! I noticed right away that the area behind the Greek Key design is not black (as depicted in the picture) but rather a light matte gray.

 Very impressed My daughter is the original fanpire of the "Twilight" series plus her man nicknamed her "Little Wolf" so when I saw this charm I HAD to get it for her. Because of the price I didn't expect much...but if you could have seen her face on Christmas morning ...I would have paid 10 times the amount! But we were both really impressed with the quality of the charm. The details were exceptional and it's weight is so solid.

 Charming little wolf I purchased this piece to create a replica of Bella's braclet from Meyer's Twilight series. Although the original was bronze in color none anywhere that I could find were like that. I chose this one because I thought it looked best of all the ones I could find. The person this gift is for was very particular about the wolf charm because it is supposed to be wooden but I think she will be satisfied with this one. I worried at first after receiving it about it possibly being too small but the size is good. The quality appears excellent.

 Pale and pretty When I first received these earrings in the mail I was confused--I couldn't remember ordering any earrings that looked like diamonds. It took me a minute to remember that I'd ordered blue topaz and to see the pale blue shining in these drop earrings. It reminds me of sea glass made from old Coke bottles but a bit more faint. The drop is almost the size of a #2 pencil eraser. Overall I've decided I like them even though I was expecting something more colorful.

 Well made; beautiful stones The heavier guage wire and leverbacks make these earrings feel very substantial and well made. The garnets have a very clear red tone (sometimes garnets are so black that you can't tell they're garnets). The wires are a bit long in the front making the stone angle downward somewhat.

 tiny and cheap the only way the picture is accurate is to say that the earrings are lever backs with garnet tear drops.the setting was larger with the stones set poorly and significantly lower on the earring than pictured additionally the stones were significantly paler [almost brown in color] and smaller than the picture.i sent these back for a return which they provided but i had to cover both shipping and return shipping.dont bother these are cheap.

 pretty but tiny These are very pretty and the quality of the stones seems good to my untrained eye. However the picture is a little deceptive. The stones are tiny and the earrings probably better suited for a child or preteen.

 not very well made The color of the stones is really pretty but the earrings aren't very well made. The posts that hold the stone are different sizes on each earring one sits down farther on the stone than the other. You can really notice it but for the price I'm not going to replace them. I just hope my friend doesn't notice since they're a gift for her.

 Great design could use a bit of QA My girlfriend and I got a matching pair of these when we started dating a year and a half ago. They've held up beautifully despite their daily beatings over the last 500+ days. Definitely Solid. And I / we LOVE the wave design - it's clean pretty and I really like the subtle clever use of negative space for the opposing waves. Like the ying and the yang.My only complaint is the welding on the outer spinning band. You can't see it in the picture but where the outer-band is welded together there's about 3mm of welding material

 My wife loved it! I really like the idea of the smaller diamonds flanking the larger one. It sparkles in the light and pairs nicely with a wedding band with 5 little diamonds across the top. Everything is in place and seems like a solid ring.My wife uses lotion and like all rings even if your careful it will fade to yellow a little over the years. My ring also with the Rhodium plating never faded as i don't use lotion.

 Slowest Order! I've been purchasing products from Amazon for a long time and this is by far the worst experience to date. The product is nice but it took 3 weeks to receive it. I purchased the expedited shipping method to surprise my girlfriend for mothers day but it still took almost 3 weeks to process this order. I highly recommend contacting the seller for processing details.

 Beautiful addition I bought it and immediately loved it. Some black funk came off for a few days but other than that it wears beautifully. I get lots of compliments too. I wear it all the time but need to be mindful with certain things while wearing it....like playing in the sand working in clay anything that can get in between the two pieces. What ever gets in it works its way out after you spin it repeatedly.

 fair price I have bought many items from Silver Insanity for myself and my daughter. The service and quality were always five star. The Millefiori jewelry is expensive everywhere online. You can not find it cheaper than $30 for a piece like that anywhere. In fact for a heart this size you are likely to pay closer to $50 elsewhere. I have seen many pieces that I paid for under $20 with Silver Insanity sold much higher in the stores. I think their prices are shockingly cheap and allow me to indulge my 6 year old with high quality silver trinkets.

Some indication on pendants of actual size? While the items look nice the long shipping period typos all over the listings and the complete lack of valuable information about these products simply exclude EVERYTHING made for sale by this seller from my shopping cart.

 Does the job... What can you really say about a glittery 4-finger pimp costume ring that says "Big Daddy"? It works well as a Pimp costume accessory. However it took some time to bend open the small rings just to make them fit onto my regular-sized men's fingers. Only a child or small lady could have gotten the ring on otherwise. Looks good but the glitter came off a little bit in some places as I struggled to make the ring fit.

 Beautiful Peridot earrings Peridot is my birthstone. Twenty to 30 years ago I purchased 6 mm round peridot earrings for around $110 from I. Magnin. The oval earrings from Amazon compare favorably in the amount of gold and stone size. From there the color and cut of the perfectly matched peridots on the Amazon pair are clearly superior. The picture doesn't do them justice. These earrings cost me less than $18 including super saver shipping. Anyone who loves peridots is going to love these earrings.

 Post is on top not in the center I ordered these earrings for my sister for her birthday. I had read another review that said the posts were on the top of the earring but I double checked the images and they clearly show the posts being in the center of the stone. This is important because if the post is at the top of the stone the earrings sit too low on your ear and they look weird. Sure enough when I asked my sister about the location of the posts (she lives in another state so I haven't seen them personally) she said that they were on the top of the setting. Needless to say I'm upset. Obviously

 Simple but Pretty Earrings I waited a long time for these to be shipped and quite honestly I signed on to cancel the order only to find they were finally preparing for shipment. Since I'd ordered them as an early August birthday gift and it then was almost September these became no longer a gift for this year. In December someone else will receive a lovely pair of pretty green peridot earrings that can be worn every day. They are of a very fine quality that I would definitely wear myself. I see nothing to criticize about either these bright stones or the well-made yellow gold earrings. Nicely matched too.

 great earrings - but stones not as dark as the picture shows I like wearing these earrings - they are simple and classic in design and since I require gold posts (get knots in my ears with other types of metal posts) the challenge is being able to afford multiple pairs and colors. For $33 I am quite satisfied with these even though the stones are not as bright and darkly colored as the picture indicates (hence four stars for this truth in advertising issue). The posts are sturdy and backs fit securely. Peridote stones are translucent and free of visible inclusions. The color goes nicely with my spring wardrobe. Appropriate for all ages. I'd highly recommend them.

 Quality garnets There is no question that the stones in these earrings for $19.99 (plus super saver status) are first rate in color and size. The reason these earrings don't get five stars from me is that they come with pretty small earring backs. For the size of the earrings not to mention that the posts are not centered the backs are too small. Considering that they are rated as being worth $75 they should have larger backs.

 My wife loved it! I really like the idea of the smaller diamonds flanking the larger one. It sparkles in the light and pairs nicely with a wedding band with 5 little diamonds across the top. Everything is in place and seems like a solid ring.My wife uses lotion and like all rings even if your careful it will fade to yellow a little over the years. My ring also with the Rhodium plating never faded as i don't use lotion.

 Slowest Order! I've been purchasing products from Amazon for a long time and this is by far the worst experience to date. The product is nice but it took 3 weeks to receive it. I purchased the expedited shipping method to surprise my girlfriend for mothers day but it still took almost 3 weeks to process this order. I highly recommend contacting the seller for processing details.

 Very nice ! This is a lovely bracelet - I do love it. The size is good. A little loose which I like for a bracelet. There's one thing that puzzles me though I can nowhere find the "Sterling Silver" Mark on the bracelet (except on the lock) and that worries me! Also I think it tarnishes very fast! But maybe that's the quality of the silver!

 blue topaz pear shape earrings The earrings are merely acceptable in color. Descriptive terms &quot;dazzling vivid ice blue with fire&quot; are an exaggeration. I would describe the gemstones as a faded denim color. The stones were small and slightly unmatched in size but that really wasn't as important as the color to me. The 14 carat leverbacks are very nice. I would not recommend the earrings unless someone was looking for light colored stones. The price however is very reasonable.

 Larger than expected These earrings are of good quality and have a nice clarity to them. Be forwarned that because of their size they may have a tendency to fall forward on the ear. I believe this can be rectified with larger earring backs. However don't wear them as often as I could. Otherwise they are a beautiful pair.

 Beautiful Earrings! Perfect for Fall! I am thrilled with the quality of these earrings and so glad that with 14k gold they are still quite affordable.The stones are excellently matched in color and just the perfect shade of brown that goes with anything. They stand out on the lobe and I was worried they'd be really small but they are not. In spite of the decent size of the stones these are really lightweight and you can't tell you're wearing them at all.I think these would make an excellent gift and I'm considering buying an additional pair just for that purpose!

 Ok but expected a bit more I purchased these as a gift for my boyfriends mom. I am really disappointed in the packaging. They came in a small box with some filler and the earrings themselves are in a very cheap little bag. I was expecting something I could just wrap up. Now I need to search out something to make it a presentable gift. The earrings themselves are nice enough seem a little on the cheap side for the posts. I guess you get what you pay for $40 worth anyway. The color of the stones is very nice. I wouldn't recommend this item to a friend. I am keeping them because they do match a necklace I got her for Christmas last year.

 Beautiful! I bought these for my mother as a birthday present. I was a little scared of the carat size (I'm not an experienced jewelry shopper). I also personally hate gold but the brown gem perfectly compliments the 14K gold setting. I'm pleasantly surprised by the size of these earrings. They are the perfect size. I thought I'd be buying something tiny but they're anything but. They're not gigantic either. After she opened her present I spent a few minutes looking over each stone. There was no scratches no visible imperfections with the settings.My mom has sensitive ears. She has a hard time find earrings that won't irritate and cause infections; the 14K gold seems to not affect her ears. She wears them all the time as a result. It makes me slightly jealous. I wish I would have bought a pair for myself as well.I'd highly recommend these earrings. They are very beautiful and well-crafted!

 way too small These earrings appear to be a decent size in the photograph but when I received them they were not much bigger than small diamond studs. They were so tiny and because of the subtle color any one would have to look hard just to be able to tell I was even wearing earrings. For the price I paid I need a smoky earring that people will see. Not one that people need glasses to find. If these earrings were larger I might have really liked them. But for now I'm sorry I will be sending these back.

 Smaller than I thought I purchased these earrings since I needed a pair of smoky-quartz earrings. When I received them I was disappointed with the size.

She took one look at the ring and fell in love.My choice was clear - I had to get it for her and these earrings perfectly completed the set.The quartz sparkles clear and smoky and offsets the warm glow of the 14k gold setting just right. She gets compliments wherever she wears them and she wears them often.Very well done!

 My thoughts I like the earrings themselves - extremely pretty - they are what I expected. The only thing that disappointed me was the size of the backings...really SMALL and which I had to replace.

 Are not as they appear in print The smoky-quartz stone was very light and appeared just lightly tinted. In addition there was no way to determine the actual size of the stones from the online description. They were much smaller than I anticipated. They might have been a nice earring under other circumstances but it was not what I thought I was ordering. They might be a nice earring for a teen girl.

 Such a light blue that it's colorless After reading the reviews on this item which stated that the stone color ranged from a nice blue to colorless. I decided that for the low price tag ($20) it was worth the risk of getting colorless stones. Unfortunately luck was not on my side and my stones were colorless. The earrings are still nice but I would have preferred them to be at least somewhat blue.

 Exactly as Pictured These earrings are exactly the color as pictured a little lighter blue then the earrings I lost that these are replacing but true to the image on Amazon. They are 6mmx4mm so before ordering check out a ruler and see if that size works for you. For me it was just right.My only criticism is that I wish the prongs had a little more bend around the stones. It seems as if the prongs are straight and I'm wondering if one day I might find a stone missing...but so far so good.

 Blue Topaz? Hard to tell! These are not as pictured. I objected to the color (a shade of blue that I am not familiar with) because they will not match with any of my traditional blue topaz jewelry nor will they match the blue topaz I have already purchased for gifts. Hard to tell what kind of stone these earrings are based on the color. However perfect size for studs with a nice setting. Sadly for my purposes these can't be "keepers."

 Really Pretty I got these earrings in 2006 so it's been 4 years now. They're still holding up still pretty and shiny. The silver is a bit tarnished but when I put them on it's not really noticeable. They're very gorgeous and you can see them from far away. I just wish the little long bar wasn't so flimsy though.

 Excellent Quality Earrings These earrings were even better than I hoped. My wife loves them. The emeralds are a perfect natural green just a shade more transparent than translucent. The baguette diamonds look larger in person. Overall they have quite a lot of sparkle and that emerald flash of pure green. I have purchased a lot of jewelry for my wife over the years and consider these one of my best purchases for the money.

 Large Poison Ring for Long Thin Fingers This ring is durable fashionable and covers very well for those of us who like large rings yet have long thin fingers. The clasp allows for safe closure of the ring's chamber without worrying it will open even if like mine it contains no item. Garnet is secure and I have received many compliments on the ring even from those who are oblivious to its chamber. Good weight; solid & fashionable design; secure chamber & stone; detailed design; fun ring!

 Pleasantly surprised I was a little concerned of the quality of these earrings when I first ordered them due to the reasonable price. However my girlfriend loves them and wears them all the time! The luster is good and the shape is virtually spherical. The peach color is fairly subtle but suits someone with a lighter complexion.

 Gorgeous High Quality Silver Necklace *****This necklace is so lovely and of such high quality; I was so pleased to receive it. It is shinier and more beautiful than the picture! Note the lobster clasp which is very sturdy and pretty as well.Since the vendor does not list it as "nickel free" I researched it on the Internet and found that apparently .925 sterling silver is always nickel free; I am mentioning this in case you are like me and were wondering about this because of allergies.The vendor ships very very quickly (I had my item within 4 days) and for the price I found everything about this necklace to be superb. I would have gladly paid twice the cost for it.Highly recommended.*****

 30" Ball Chain Necklace I wanted a long ball chain that I could tuck in my shirt when I wanted to hide it and that I could just pull over my head when I wanted to remove it. This is that necklace. It's perfect if you are looking for a longer chain to wear a locket or pendant on especially if you want something with a little edge to it. It can look tough or feminine depending on how or what you wear with it. I love it. Good price great service. I'm very satisfied.

 Fabulous Pouch! I was concerned at first due to the above review. But I really like the color which matches my bridesmaids' dress. I called the company and found out that the company has quality guarantee on its products and in case of a defective product the repair shipping will be on the company. As I need to buy 7 of them I explained my concern to the company. The company said it had tried every way but was unable to find the above reviewer from its customer. Since the seller has 99% positive feedback I took a chance and bought 7 of them for my bridesmaids back in July. And everyone is very pleased. Overall I would recommend the pouch.

 Made an excellent gift I got this as a Chrismas gift for a friend from her wish list so she really picked it out. She does a lot of traveling and says that she loves it. The only thing she felt could use improvement was that the necklace pocket only worked for short chains but that doesn't make her love it any less. If I were still a traveler (those days are behind me) I'd consider one for myself.

 Decent This works rather well for my needs though there are a few ways in which it seems cheaply made. The tassels seem to come apart (and the stuffing comes out of them) very easily and happened not only on mine but on the one I gave as a gift. If you intend to give one as a gift make sure that you sew some reinforcing stitches on the end of the tassels to keep them closed. I also had to move the "button" to which the ring-holder loops so that the ring holder would be pulled snug and not loose as a wet noodle.Otherwise the fact that this is silky and has multiple compartments makes it suitable for holding jewelry.

 Hits a home run! I have 10 nieces from whom I buy Christmas gifts every year and it's really a challenge to find them something unique that I hope they will like and use for years to come. These jewelry rolls are outstanding. The price is incredidbly cheap for heavy embroidered satin and the jewelry roll has several zippered pockets plus a large pouch for larger items and a place for rings. The colors are brilliant and vivid and appeal to a woman of any age from 14 to 60. I personally purchased 8 of these for my nieces (the other nieces being just a bit too young for this) and also purchased one for myself. You really can't go wrong with this item.

The colors are vibrant (the pink flowers and the birds really stand out against the blue fabric) and the stitching looks well done.

 Great buy! I was specifically looking for a compact jewelry case and this one fit the bill. It fits neatly in my suitcase and is beautiful besides. The design is well thought-out and it holds everything I need for travel. This would be an ideal gift too.

 silky brocade jewelry travel organizer roll pouch I really like this product I could fit a lot of jewelry inside the only problem I had was with the button for the ring tube coming loose on my trip and having to re-sew that when I got back home. Otherwise it packed great and kept the jewelry from tangling.

 Jewelry Travel Accessory Just the perfect way to carry jewelry in your purse. Separate compartments prevent pieces of jewelry from tangling . Vibrant colors in silk brocade enhance the look. I purchased one in each of the these colors of champagne gold crimson and blue to give as gifts to my friends.

 Love it! Love it. The ring holder is a great idea and buttons and it's not hidden so you can see them when you open the roll. The zippered pockets inside are a little smaller than I anticipated(some of my pieces of jewelry are large but would hold standard necklaces and earrings well) but the quality is excellent and the overall size is perfect. Not too big and will fit in my small travel vanity bag along with my other items. Can't wait to use it for our upcoming cruise. The quality is truly very good! I purchased it in the garnet red color and it's beautiful. I plan on getting a few in other colors for gifts.

 Crapola I could not believe how many people rated this item favorably. I was shocked when I opened it. It is such poor quality that I can't even believe they are charging fifteen bucks for it. It's worth about three and I bet you could find it in any Chinatown for that. Probably even better for three bucks!It is extremely small too. The zippers are poor quality and the stitching that holds the ring guard and button on look like they are about to fall off...very poorly made. Even the embroidery is horrendous.My mom gave me one of these years ago that puts this one to shame. I saw one in The Met catalog I think I'll head over to their site and see if it's on sale.At any rate I am gonna keep looking and return this junk. A pillowcase would be better than this!

 Beautiful little item also makes a great gift! This small little jewelry roll holds a lot of jewelry. 3 zippered pockets keep things from tageling and the ring roll is great. Also has a pocket that goes the length of the roll. This is silky in texture (but not silk). It's really pretty and will be perfect for travelling. I've also giftlisted this to get some for all my friends for the holidays. Love it!

 Just what I was looking for! I was looking for a jewelry pouch to keep my jewelry safe and untangled when I travel. I love that this pouch has three small zipper compartments instead of on big one so that things don't get tangled. There is a cushion that unhooks so that you can put your rings on it and they are kept in place. There is also a pocket the size of the entire pouch behind the zipped compartments for larger items like bangles then you just fold the pouch over and it's closed. It is a great size and very beautiful. I'm thinking about getting a few more for Christmas gifts every woman should have one of these!

 It's okay... The jewelry roll is very pretty. My problem is that this was the best out of what was offered. My ideal would have clear pockets so you don't have to look through each pocket to see what's in it. I do think that the Ring holder is a unique feature. However I feel it is just an over-priced item that could probably be bought at any flea market or chinatown.

 Beautiful necklace gift for Amy Lee I purchased this beautiful necklace especially for Amy Lee (Evanescence) for her birthday on December 13th because I admire & respect her and I love her music soo much.I chose this necklace since Amy's birthstone is the Topaz and I believe she also likes heart shaped necklaces. It is so beautiful in its genuine Mystic pink Topaz stone and its beautiful heart shape.I really hope that Amy liked it.

 Mega Bold A weighty well made bold ring. It sets up about 11mm off the finger and is 13x26mm overall. You can't overlook this ring. The amethyst is a nice medium color with good life. The galley and underside is completely finished with filagree type work. the shank is 3mm so it stays balanced which is good as it is quite heavy. It fits the curve of your finger so is very comfortable. The MQ stone is set on a diagonal which gives a unique flair. Overall a lot of ring for a little money. Make sure you like them bold tho!

 MY BIG PIMPIN CHAIN Man that pic don't even do it right. It's a lot fatter in real life than it is in the pic. And it's a good weight you can tell when you hold it it aint junk. Don't get me wrong when I can afford a gold chain I'll get me one but until then this looks and feels D**N good. I know the girls like it. Ohh and I had it like 3 mos and I just cleaned it for the first time and for some reason after it gets dirty then cleaned for the first time - it seems to look even better? There some chains on here almost as big but look at the weight. My hommie got one for like a bill and it feels so light he should a just got one out of a 25cent machine.

 A well made pretty CZ bracelet Needed a medium substantial looking bracelet to go with my wedding dress. My dress is free of decoration and the bracelet is going to be a secondary focal point. Was pleasantly surprise that it was very pretty and well made CZ bracelet and worthy of wearing on my wedding. Has a couple of slide in and latch clasps which makes the bracelet feel weighty and "expensive".

 Pretty but not exactly as pictured These are nice small earrings but they don't look quite as nice as shown. The stones I got had more green in them and they lacked the black marks. As a result I would probably think they were enamel and not real turquoise if I saw them on someone (though I have no reason to think that they are actually fake). Also the stone is only on one side.Like I said

 Beautiful ring This ring is beautiful! Everyone that I showed it to thought that I had it custom made. I was worried about diamond quality and size at only 1/2C for 7 diamonds but they are white and clear and huge (almost too big- at some angles overwhelm the infinity- much bigger in person than pictured). My only concern is the elevated twist and larger diamonds make it look a bit feminine. But this ring has everything I ever wanted and looks like the drawings my husband and I made of our dream ring. I am going to a jeweler to see if I can have the twist inset since it is a separete piece. Otherwise diamonds are mounted flat and ring is absolutely stunning. Can't beat the price anywhere usually runs $600+ (I've been watching this ring for our anniversary for 4 years!). Completely recommend.Since purchasing I took the ring to a jeweler and had the raised infinity section lowered into the band. They only charged $75 (and I had picked it up during a $50 off sale!) and it looks exquisite and masculine. My husband loves it and we still can't get over the fact that I found the ring he designed online.

 really cool looking... ...but order a larger size than you think you'll need because the bands are thick and since it's entirely stone there's not as much "give" as with a metal ring. I ordered two jade rings and one of them broke the second time I put it on. Jade's not as durable as the other stones they offer. I recommed the agate ones as more sturdy.

 Perfect! Recieved this ring in a timely fashion. It did last a long time. I had this ring for about 2 years. Because of the material it is very fragile. Smacked it against a marble table and broke it right off of my finger. Definitely will order another one to replace the old one.

 Perfectly Beautiful Ring! Both I and my new husband love this ring! It is elegant unique and tasteful - yet manly! (And that's a tall order...) It is the perfect ring for my new husband! He's received MANY compliments on it. It's not too flashy or gaudy very tasteful. We are extremely pleased with this purchase. (I was very hesitant to buy something as important as our WEDDING ring online without actually seeing it.) The diamonds are beautiful. I am not a jeweler but I don't see any flaws in the ring. It is quality craftsmanship.

 Beautiful ring This ring is beautiful! Everyone that I showed it to thought that I had it custom made. I was worried about diamond quality and size at only 1/2C for 7 diamonds but they are white and clear and huge (almost too big- at some angles overwhelm the infinity- much bigger in person than pictured). My only concern is the elevated twist and larger diamonds make it look a bit feminine. But this ring has everything I ever wanted and looks like the drawings my husband and I made of our dream ring. I am going to a jeweler to see if I can have the twist inset since it is a separete piece. Otherwise diamonds are mounted flat and ring is absolutely stunning. Can't beat the price anywhere usually runs $600+ (I've been watching this ring for our anniversary for 4 years!). Completely recommend.Since purchasing I took the ring to a jeweler and had the raised infinity section lowered into the band. They only charged $75 (and I had picked it up during a $50 off sale!) and it looks exquisite and masculine. My husband loves it and we still can't get over the fact that I found the ring he designed online.

 Pretty I really like these earrings! Pretty and delicate they're very lightweight - you feel like you're not wearing anything at all. Only problem is they irritate my sensitive ears... they must only be sterling plated because pure sterling has never given me a problem before.

 Very nice ring for the price I am completely satisfied with this ring. It has bigger stones and a nicer style than comparably priced rings. If you are looking for a 3-stone mother's ring this is by far the nicest I found. It came beautifully presented in a wooden ring box and velvet bag!I am impressed and very pleased.

 Don't be afraid to order online. I was like most people perhaps a little apprehensive about ordering jewelry online. I read the reviews from other's who purchased this ring and felt a little more confident.I am happy to say that I am very pleased with the total experience from this vendor. The ring isn't "cheap" looking at all. It has some substance to it and the stones they used are very nice indeed. It comes in it's own wooden gift box inside a plain white box inside a nice blue velvet bag nice. It's a beautiful piece of jewelry at a very reasonable price.The staff at finejewelers were easy to work with. Communication was great and the turn around time was excellent! I read that they will call you but I emailed them first. They returned my email very promptly to confirm my stone choices and emailed me when my order shipped. Excellent. Thank you FineJewelers!

 overall a positive experience I too was skeptical about purchasing jewelry online. However I also struggled to find a substantial mothers ring anywhere at a reasonable price so I gave it a shot. The ordering process was easy and the ring came very quickly. In general I am happy with the experience. The stones are a nice size. One of the stones is set crooked so I will have to have it re-set since I don't have time to send it back to the company before I give it to my mom for her birthday. Overall I don't think you can do better at this price point for the size of the stones the fact that they are genuine and that it has real diamonds.

 overall a positive experience I too was skeptical about purchasing jewelry online. However I also struggled to find a substantial mothers ring anywhere at a reasonable price so I gave it a shot. The ordering process was easy and the ring came very quickly. In general I am happy with the experience. The stones are a nice size. One of the stones is set crooked so I will have to have it re-set since I don't have time to send it back to the company before I give it to my mom for her birthday. Overall I don't think you can do better at this price point for the size of the stones the fact that they are genuine and that it has real diamonds.

 Excellent Mother's Ring I absolutely loved this ring and received it VERY quickly. Most jewelry stores take weeks to deliver a ring like this. Not to mention the prices are ridiculous and most are only 10kt gold with synthetic stones. I would recommend this ring to anyone! My mother absolutely loved it and how unique it is from most Mother's rings. I'm a very satisfied customer!

 Nice but stone is lighter than pictured The Swiss Blue stones are pretty clear and sparkly. But lighter blue than pictured. I would consider them a little darker than Sky Blue Topaz but not quite Swiss Blue Topaz. A shade lighter than Swiss Blue is the best description. The setting is nice just not sure if I'm going to return it. I bought it as a gift for my step daughter to wear to a wedding she is a bridesmaid in. Her gown is Caribbean Blue. Swiss Blue is a perfect match for that color. If the color of the stone were a "true" Swiss Blue I would definitely keep it. I'm just so disappointed it is not the color blue pictured. Great price though for the quality of the item.

 Very nice ring for the price I am completely satisfied with this ring. It has bigger stones and a nicer style than comparably priced rings. If you are looking for a 3-stone mother's ring this is by far the nicest I found. It came beautifully presented in a wooden ring box and velvet bag!I am impressed and very pleased.

 My favorite earrings! (Review by Jessica) I received these several years ago from my husband. Best Christmas gift ever! They are my favorite earrings and I have lent them to my sister for her wedding (something borrowed...). Lovely and perfect they have the advantage of being a typical pearl stud earring with the 'zest' of the white golden swirl.

 Junk Brought it to a jewelry store to get engraved and they wouldn't even do it because they said it was just a silver laminate and it would peel. It was supposed to be worth $100 and the jeweler told me it was worth less than $20. I would not reccamend the Neteya Corp. The only good thing I have to say about them is that they refunded my money quickly and easily.

 Not air-tight This is a nice leather box and looks impressive. But it is not good for storing cigars because it is not air-tight. When I hold it up to a lamp I can see light coming through. Also the hygrometer is not accurate. I put it in my large humidor and it gives me a different reading than my other two hygrometers (-11%). To make it worse the hole in the lid is too large and the hyrgometer falls out. Made in China.

 A Gift for my husband I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he really liked it! This is a great starting point for a first time humidor user. The construction was pretty good but of course is is not the highest quality. I didn't buy this with the intention of use for travel just to get my husband to start learning about how to properly use humidors. It was perfect for that and he still uses it today and one day we'll invest in a larger desktop version.

 Best cigar travel case Purchased this for my father in law and he has been using it faithfully for the past 2 years. It is well made sturdy and keeps his cigars perfectly humidified during travel. The box is a great size not too big or too small and has enough room for cigars for him and his son to last almost a week. Worth the money for sure!

 Cute but ... I love cats and my favorite color is purple so I was happy to find these - and they were reasonably priced.It would have been soooo much better if the kittens on the earrings were made to face each other (one facing left one facing right) rather than both pointed in the same direction. I like symmetry and balance. What you don't see in the item photo is the hole in the center of the Amethyst Stone. One of the cats almost covers it the other is farther up on the stone making the hole more noticeable. If you are particular about things like this

 Hmmm I bought this item partially based on the 5 star review. I would say that there is no way that a person would mistake this ring as being real near or far. It looks like inexpensive costume jewellery. Also the edges are really really sharp and when I do wear it catches on things and cuts me with the corners.

 My sister loved them I spend most of my time in Africa on business and my sister has been after me to bring her Giraffe ear-rings for ages.

 Lovely ring but short-lived It was beautiful and difficult to discern from the real thing. After some time the cz emerald accumulated scratches and lost its lustre. If there was a way to restore it by buffing out the scratches and making it reflective again that would be wonderful. As it is it's an alright buy--it is silver and only $40 but I would've liked to see the stone hold out a bit longer for that price.

 Incredible! With green being my favorite color I couldn't wait to get this ring! I've recently started wearing silver again and this beauty just made a permanent place on my finger!! The deep dark green is beautiful and the stones accenting it down the side just make it that much more beautiful. The feel is great and the size of the stones are just big enough to not make it look like costume jewelry.

 Scratches really easy It looks awesome out of the box. Just like the picture. But within a couple of days I could start to see that it was getting scratched even when I was being consciously extra careful. After that I figured it wasn't going to make much of a difference whether I was careful or not. That made life lots easier.

 An eye-catching piece of jewelry I am a very hard person to buy jewelry for but even my pickiness couldn't mar my opinion when I got this necklace as a gift. It is very light and can be fairly casual or formal depending on your needs and the adjustable length makes it easier to tailor to your desired neckline. My only problem as is also described by the other reviewer is that it is easy for the necklace to migrate a little to one side without you noticing and because it is not a pendant sliding on a chain

 Scratches really easy It looks awesome out of the box. Just like the picture.

 Ruby Pendant I purchased this for my sister as a birthday present. I was very pleased with this created ruby necklace. The fire and brillance are amazing and would have cost quite a pretty penny had they been mined instead of lab created. The chain looks delicate at first glance but the links they use are quite sturdy. My sister loved it and I will look for other items on Amazon from Netaya in the future.

 Very good quality Akoya pearls  but not very pink The pearls in my pair of earrings were not as pink as they appear in the picture. Mine are more of a champagne peach color although they look pinker if you wear a pink shirt with them. But I like them anyway because they turned out to be an exact match to a pendant I already own. The Akoya pearls in these earrings are very good quality round and perfectly matched as to size and color. The clutchbacks are not teeny tiny but are big enough to grasp easily.

 Sterling Silver Clear Star It does not feel like Swaroski crystal to the touch more like plastic. I even went back to the description of the product to make sure I did not make a mistake while ordering. I'm still a bit doubtful on what it's actually made of.The star is about the size of a quarter and shines mostly gold with green blue or bronze tones depending on the light or the cloth its worn against.

 OMG DOES IT SPARKLE!!!! Honestly for $10 I wasn't expecting too much but when I opened the cute little silver box that this pendant came in I was shocked at how sparkly this cute little star was! I wore it out the night I got it (just running errands) and got a bunch of compliments on it! I'm a sucker for anything sparkling (my husband will tell you how I browse through the Swarovski store wiping drool from my mouth) and this pendant sure fits the bill! True that there is no documentation or even a stamp on the box to say that it's genuine swarovski but it's so pretty who cares!

 bright & shiney star!! I bought 1 of these for my Granddaughter for Christmas and had it sent to me to check out first. It was much better looking than I expected. I bought it on sale which was a steal. But it would be a bargain at regular price. I also bought the sterling snake chain to go with the pendant. It was gorgeous!!I even bookmarked Gem Avenue on my computer for future occasions since I have 3 Grandchildren in 3 different states. Now that I have seen the quality I can have them ship.

 Need to Realize... While I'm sure that this bracelet is lovely I would like to let you know that if you have a Piercing Pagoda in your local mall they sell Italian silver 925 stamped charm bracelets (7-8inches) for less than being charged here. Even with tax the ultimate price of the bracelet is cheaper than purchasing it online and paying shipping. My 7 inch bracelet is well made hasn't lost any of its shine and I only payed 19 dollars.I cannot imagine that the quality differs drastically from this product to the one I purchased. It is stamped with "Italy" like the above bracelet as well as "925" and you also don't have to wait for it to arrive in the mail.

 Looks like junk Let me give you a hint I found this same one on the side walk looking for the owner I looked it up this thing has a broken clasp and the "shiny silver" people are talking about now looks like a vending machine bracelet. I was surprised to see this thing cost as much as it did because it looks like it came from the dollar store so if you want a bracelet that you will end up loosing because the clasp breaks and looks like trash

 Not Happy Purchase these for my daughters comparing these to the one I purchase for my wife at the local jewelery store (not paying much more than this one) they seem like costume crap even the feel seems cheap....and so close to xmas it's hard to exchange now..even bought a number of charms for the both of them....I remember getting my kids fake jewelery out of the vending machines that look about the same...sorry but would not buy again...NO WAY

 Cute not the best quality Received these as a gift off my wish list...I do love the style of these earrings but the quality is a little lacking which is to be expected for this price. The backing on one of the earrings is a bit loose so it has me worried that I might lose one earring. Other than a slightly loose clasp very cute earrings and overall I'm pleased.

 Simple and classic beauty I bought a pair of these earrings for my daughter and she loved -- wore them every day. Then about 4 or 6 months later I bought a pair for myself and loved them so much I wore them every day. They are very light and the perfect size. After a couple of years my daughter lost one of her earrings. One of mine got severely misshapen from encounters with the over-the-ear headset I wear at work. The one downside for these earrings are a little soft for everyday wear. Still I plan to buy another pair.

 Terrific earrings Everything you could hope for in a pair of hoops. Lightweight easy to fasten great size. The one beef I have is the clasp can pop open and you can lose it...I have this earring in three sizes...but only ONE of each. I could try to wear mismatching sizes but I think I'd look a bit lame so I have to get replacements. Interesting that price went up by $5 in this economy. That's a bummer...

 Poor Quality Let me preface this by saying that I've had two pairs of silver hoop earrings that each lasted more than a decade before I lost them.This pair did not last more than two months before one of the posts broke off at the base of the hoop (poor solder joint.) I never slept with them on or wore them while running exercising or dancing so it was not from any misuse or abnormal wear.Besides the weak link I also did not like the look. I couldn't tell from the picture that the hoops are flat not tubes. From the side they look great but from the front they are not very noticable because they are very very thin.

 Cute but sophisticated with a 70's vibe This is a very nice bracelet. It definitely does not look like it cost only $42. The design is stylized so it doesn't look like a kiddie bracelet. The colors and design give it sort of a 70's vibe. I like it a lot. It is somewhat difficult to put on like all bracelets with lobster claws.

 Double oval design complements most face types. This design complements most face types as big round rings can make a round face look bigger and broader. The finish is polished silver and not the burnished finish you see in the pictures. The earnings are about 2.5 inches long and solid not the usual feather weight silver hoops so they might feel heavy if you wear them all day. They clink slightly as you move around. Overall a great purchase especially at the 50% off special in the gold box.

The posts on the hoops are bigger than i expected but i had no problems getting them through my holes. They are hollow inside like the previous review said but they still have a heavy weight even for being hollow.

The rainbow of blue colors are brilliant and the size of the pendant is large enough to display the range of colors and small enough to not look gaudy.

I think you'll be very pleased with this pendant.

 Gets attention and looks expensive After reading other reviews I decided to purchase the blue pendant. It came quickly and was as pretty as I had hoped for. I am wearing it on a 16 inch silver snake style chain and the pairing makes it look much more expensive than it was. I got alot of compliments on it and might order another color. I'm not sure if the painted backing would hold up to everyday wear but I'm only wearing it a couple times a month. Would recommend to others.

 wearing this today I am wearing this pendant as I am writing this. It's very very pretty only trouble I had was that some of the backing flaked off so it is clear in a spot or two. For the money it is quite eye catching. It's not a forever piece but so pretty in the sun!

 Very nice pendant I bought this as a Christmas gift for my best friend since she likes crystals. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the item was when it arrived. I wasn't expecting it to be as colorful as it was in the picture but it's really nice--from one side it looks solid blue but from the other side you can see multiple colors. I'm pretty sure she'll like it though I'm tempted to keep it myself haha.

 Beautiful pendant. But take these reviews with a grain of salt. The pendant is beautiful and I think its recipient liked it. It is smaller and thinner than I'd expected but that's my own fault for not looking up the product dimensions.That said anyone buying this product on the virtue of the reviews should be aware that whenever Gem Avenue receives a positive seller rating they request that their buyers review the products positively as well. Therefore the reviews that appear here are skewed to reflect the buyers who liked the product not those who didn't.I for one

 Beautiful jade I ordered two of these pendants for Valentine's day gifts for my sons' girlfriends. The pendant is very beautiful and both noticeable and subtle at the same time. I had never seen pink jade before but it is a very pale soft pink and looks lovely against all skin tones. I purchased also from this site the sterling silver Italian 1mm box chain to hang the pendant from but it would be beautiful on a silk ribbon or cord as well.

 Excellent Engagement Ring I've always liked the symbolism behind the claddagh. This went over very well when I proposed to my wife and has drawn a fair number of compliments. This has very high quality in general and is much more interesting than the standard engagement ring. The only downside is that the little crown does sometimes snag on things but the 10k is hard enough that this hasn't damaged the ring.

 Really Pretty but Cheaply Made I bought this ring about a month ago and have worn it 4 or 5 times. It's really beautiful but one of the tiny pearls has already fallen out. When I got it out of the box I expected it to be heavier than it was. It's very light weight and apparently not very well made. I'm bummed because it is a pretty ring but definitely not worth the price as it's already damaged. I'd say it's worth about $20 max.

 Scratches really easy It looks awesome out of the box. Just like the picture. But within a couple of days I could start to see that it was getting scratched even when I was being consciously extra careful. After that I figured it wasn't going to make much of a difference whether I was careful or not. That made life lots easier.

 Great Experience & Beautiful Pendant This beautiful horse pendant was my first Christmas Gift to my newly Sister-in-Law. I was in such a panic to get it by Christmas because I am one of those people that waits until the very last minute to go shopping on the holidays. Thankfully the people at Netaya and Amazon.com were very helpful in making my wonderful gift to her possible. The pendant was BEAUTIFULL and she was very pleased. Thank you so much!!

 Lovely This ring has a lovely sheen to it. It took my breath away when I opened the box. It is very comfortable. However you should know that it is not filigree all the way around. This makes it very comfortable. However it leaves an odd juxtoposition between the lacy filigree and the practical band beneath.The stone also comes out quite a way from my finger making it a pretty tall ring.

 Expectations Exceeded When I ordered this ring I thought that it would be nice. I didn't expect it to be such an eye-catching piece of jewelry. Everyone I work with noticed it and asked where I got it. I've received more compliments on this ring than my diamond wedding ring which cost thousands of dollars! This ring has exceeded my expectations. I am very happy with my purchase and would not hesitate to buy this ring as a nice gift for a graduate or close family member. I only wish it came in a ring box rather than a small zip-lock bag inside of a flat box. If you package it yourself it will make a nice gift.

 Great Ring! I purchased this as an engagement ring for my girlfriend. The ring arrived very quickly and was very beautiful. It is not a big ring but then again I didn't expect it to be. It is perfect for what I wanted it for. Quality of the ring looks great no visible problems what-so-ever. I would recommend this ring to anyone looking for a great gift or engagement ring that won't break the bank.

 Tasteful and graceful The length of this necklace falls in good proportion to a typical V-neck sweater. The green and pink gold of the leaf motif slider provide interesting and enjoyable contrast to the bright yellow gold of the necklace without overwhelming it or looking tawdry. The overall effect of the piece is mature tasteful and and noticable without being overstated.

 *Too* tiny! I've been looking for small silver or white gold studs to make it less obvious that I have seven total ear piercings and these seemed like the perfect solution! However be warned that when they say "tiny" they mean "tiny." The ball is so itty-bitty that I can literally pull the stud-side all the way through my ear with no pain whatsoever. So far they haven't just fallen out though which is great.So these are perfect if you're looking to make piercings practically disappear from view

 Above Average Quality I bought 3 pairs of these nose studs because I actually purchased them for my ears. I have 3 holes in each ear and they are the perfect size if you are going for a classic look. They are very small but not so small that they fall out. This is actually the second set that I've purchased from Sabrina Silver. I purchased the first set about a year ago and I wore them every day. The only time I took them out was to clean them. They held up pretty well but I use rubbing alcohol to clean them and it wears the silver finish off after a while. They are not solid sterling. They must just be coated with sterling. Overall they are a good value for the price. I am very satisfied.

 Too small These fit the description--they are very tiny; much more tiny than I imagined. I'm returning these just because they're too small for my second piercing but I can't complain much because they're exactly what they say they are! These would probably work better as a nose stud not an earring. I've been very pleased with my other orders from Sabrina Silver though and would definitely recommend them to anyone.

 Nose studs. I was looking for 1mm earrings to use as nose studs - I bend them into an L shape and wear them that way. These ended up being a little too small for my liking. I think I prefer 1.5mm balls as the 1mm ball is about the same size as the post itself. However this is not the company's fault!

 Necklace not as advertised When I received this is the mail I was disappointed. It did not sparkle as my other Swarovksi pieces and the silver cheapens the look. I expected more crystals and less silver- unfortunately I did not get what was pictured. I even contacted the seller to see about returning it. The only reason I kept this over-priced piece was because I had also purchased the matching earrings and bracelet. The bracelet (the one with just crystals no silver beads) is stunning and the earrings are decent.

 Antica Murrina Veneziana Cancun Necklace Bracelet & Earrings Not even worth the 1 star!!! I purchased the Antica Murrina Veneziana Cancun Necklace Bracelet & Earrings as a Christmas surprise for my sister on NOVEMBER 28th. I received a "your order has been shipped" email on NOVEMBER 30th with a tracking numbering. It is now DECEMBER 18th and I still do not have my purchase!!! When I view UPS to track it has been stuck in the UPS warehouse since DECEMBER 1st. I have called UPS over a half-dozen times and each person gives me a different answer as to why it's being held in customs. I finally got tired of doing the leg work and emailed FORZIERI (the jewelry vendor) 3 times to see if they had better luck. Someone finally emailed me back on DECEMBER 16th saying they would look into why it's being held. I have not received anything further from them. At this point I am extremely frustrated and disappointed. This was supposed to be a fun Christmas surprise for my sister who had this jewelry on her wishlist. I can't believe the time I'm spending just to get this package.

 Gorgeous and nicely priced It looked very nice in the picture so we went to the nearest jeweler and got our sizes and ordered. We didn't expect the rings to look quite as nice as pictured but they do. Very impressive quality. Very distinct appearance.

 Scratches really easy It looks awesome out of the box. Just like the picture. But within a couple of days I could start to see that it was getting scratched even when I was being consciously extra careful. After that I figured it wasn't going to make much of a difference whether I was careful or not. That made life lots easier.

 Nice This piece was amazingly beautiful but like most glass it's fragile and a portion of the ring broke off after only a few wearings (apparently it hit against a checkout counter). Not sure why there is a gap in the bottom of the ring but may have contributed.

 Lovely This ring has a lovely sheen to it. It took my breath away when I opened the box. It is very comfortable. However you should know that it is not filigree all the way around. This makes it very comfortable. However it leaves an odd juxtoposition between the lacy filigree and the practical band beneath.The stone also comes out quite a way from my finger making it a pretty tall ring.

 Expectations Exceeded When I ordered this ring I thought that it would be nice. I didn't expect it to be such an eye-catching piece of jewelry. Everyone I work with noticed it and asked where I got it. I've received more compliments on this ring than my diamond wedding ring which cost thousands of dollars! This ring has exceeded my expectations. I am very happy with my purchase and would not hesitate to buy this ring as a nice gift for a graduate or close family member. I only wish it came in a ring box rather than a small zip-lock bag inside of a flat box. If you package it yourself it will make a nice gift.

 update I had left a review for this product not to long ago that was not the best. I had sent an email to the company stating that the hygrometer was not working properly and I never received a response. They called me eventually because of the bad review I had left and said that they had never received the email I sent. I am choosing to re-review this product now because granted email is not always reliable and now that I have had this humidor for a length of time my feelings have changed. I would like now to state that this product is a very reliable piece. It has been almost a month since the last time I recharged the humidification devises and they are completely dried out. This is a good thing as far as I am concerned because I am having a problem still with keeping the humidity lower at the proper level. This tells me that this humidor has an excellent seal. My hygrometer still does not work (the one that came with the humidor; I have since bought a digital one) but the company did offer to replace it for me when I had talked to them. I did not have it replaced because with the size of the humidor it took almost 2 or 3 weeks to season it and prepare it for cigar storage so I declined their offer. As far recommending this product

 Just what I needed I just needed a cord to replace on my favorite necklace. I used to use a thin chain which was pretty annoying.This just arrived and it gets the job done. Seems sturdy enough for a necklace. The clasp is very thin and delicate but as with all necklaces as long as you don't reef on it it won't break. The cord is somewhat thick so I can see this not fitting some very fine/small things. For me it works very well delivered quickly and in perfect condition. It is quite stretchy as well so I have a hard time imagining this breaking anythime soon. The rubber it is made out of is quite smooth and comfortable so I hardly even notice it.The only bad thing I can say about this and it is a very minor complaint

They were as beautiful in person as they were in the picture and the shipping speed from the company was good as well.

I was extremely pleased with this purchase and my coworker seems to love them as well she wears them frequently.

 1/2 ct. each 5mm cz studs Xlnt price and very pretty. My wife only likes real diamoonds but I suggested that until we had the money to try these. She really loves them and wears them regularly. They are not obnoxious and look very classy. I believe going up to a 7-8mm would also work. Having 1/2 and 3/4 carat depending on the situation would be nice. OK maybe even 1 carat would work

 Don't do it It's too big. Doesn't look good. Too big giving the appearance of being really really fake. No one should ever wear cubics this big. Looks like glass in settings. Face it we all want cubics to look like diamonds. Save your time and get the smaller versions. Half the size of this one. They look much better.

 Great for your money!! I bought this piece as an everyday ring and I am very pleased with it. Obviously its not Tiffany quality but it is very durable and you can't tell the difference if you look at it. It buffs up nicely even with a t-shirt and you can't beat the price. I was skeptical at first but I am very happy with this purchase. Biggest advice - go almost a half step larger then your ring size bc it is a girthy ring.

 Good buy This is a pretty cool ring; the design scrapes easily if you're rough with it but it's not a big deal. I like the design as well.The only improvement I would make would be to slim it down a bit; it's a tad wide for my taste.

 Very Pretty I'm a fan of bioplast since the first time I wore one of these! They feel great and the variety of colors is amazing! I love the combination of simple shape convenience (no pain no sticking to clothes no weird marks on your skin when you wake up in the morning) and pretty colors! You can mix and match with your outfit and it always looks good! Love love love them!

 Nothing special Discolouration kicks in very quickly and you're left with a yellowish barbell. I never really noticed anything "glow in the dark" about it. It's nothing special so don't waste your time unless you're really tired of your solid colour barbell.

 I wanted... Something safer on my teeth than steel but wanted the look of steel in my mouth.. So the picture of this barbell is VERY inaccurate. I was expecting very condensed glitter for a completely silver look.. The silver is very much spaced out and awkward looking.. Clear beads with very little glitter..The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the acrylic flexible nature IS comfortable.

 Scratches really easy It looks awesome out of the box. Just like the picture. But within a couple of days I could start to see that it was getting scratched even when I was being consciously extra careful.

 I loved these at first!!! My husband and I were a week away from getting married and still could not agree on our wedding band set. We came across these and instantly fell in love with them.. I ordered them right away and got them 2 days later. The color on the bands were perfect and the outside of the ring was smooth and beautiful.. It was exactly what we wanted.. We haev been married for 3 weeks today and we are so unhappy with the quality of these rings. The color is coming off of mine and is almost completely off my husbands and they are scratched.. I thought titanium was the strongest metal and that if wouldn't scratch... The seller is trying to work with us to make us happy.. I guess we'll see.

 Don't even know they are there!!! Just purchased 4 of the Skin Eyelets from Steel Navel in 2g 4g and 6g. First off shipping was very prompt and all items were exactly as described.As far as the Skin Eyelets they are pretty sweet. They are so lightweight you don't even know they are there. I work in a cold storage facility and not wearing metal in my ears is really nice. The cold used to sink right in before. Another nice thing about these is they don't cause the usual foul smell that other jewelry does. They are flared just enough to hold them in. I have had three in for a week and have not had any come out when sleeping or showering.Putting them in especially the smaller sizes was a little tricky. In fact I could not get the 6g one in until I had a brainstorm. I folded the Skin Eyelet side to side twice and put in in the non-flared end of one of my single flared tunnels leaving just enough to grip out of it. I slid the tunnel in enough to grip the Eyelet from the back and held it as I pulled the tunnel back out. The Eyelet unfolded and was in as easy as that with some slight adjustment. The bigger sizes are a little easier to get in without any kind of assistance.All in all I am happy with these. How long they will hold up is hard to tell. But for now this is all I will wear. So much more comfortable than metal.

 Good Looking Inside and Out! I purchased this jewelry box as a gift for my son. The price was right (as of 12/2011) but I was a little worried that the lower price would translate into a cheap looking box.My fears were unfounded. This is a very nice looking box. It is sturdy made out of wood with black faux leather stretched over it. The fake leather is nicely turned and fitted. There are no wrinkles or gaps etc. It is elegant looking. As it's not real leather it will not wear the same as leather

 Very good!! I really liked this piece. The detail on the dragon is really good and it is slightly heavy so you would need to put in a thicker chain. The only thing I found off about it was that the glass sphere was darker than expected against skin. It only looks the red in the photo when light shines through it. Anywhere else it is almost black with a slight red tint. Other than that I love it. Got lots of notice wearing it.

 Beautiful blues to brighten summer toes. This is one of several toe rings purchased from the same maker and they are quite spectacular. The material is nice and heavy with enough give to adjust.

 Add a little spice to your life and a little dazzle to your feet! Toe Rings are fairly new to the West but they have been a part of women's fashions elsewhere for millennia. Men find women's feet sexually exciting especially when they accessorized with high heeled shoes and open shoes can be made further enticing with the addition of toe rings.This toe ring is nice and elegant with excellent eye quality. Its silver and tiny stones sparkle and really come to life. Combine this nice ring with some dangly crystal earrings (like Loot Blue Stacey Swarovski Crystal Earrings!)

 Very nice I really like this stud. It's cute and you can see it. And the shipping was lightening fast. I was shocked it got here before Christmas and I can show it off. Beware of the size if you are used to a smaller size. This one is closer to the normal piercing size than the cheepies you buy in stores so it's a little bigger and not as comfortable when first put in your nose. But after a few minutes it's fine and looks good too.

 Brighten summer toes! This is one of several toe rings I bought and I have to admit that I am overall VERY PLEASED with it. It is well made fits nicely and has very good sparkly stones. The 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that the stones are very very light--much lighter than the image. It looks a lot like the faux diamond one rather that a multi-colored one. However it is very attractive

 Second Review for Angel Light Ring I reviewed this item shortly I received it and was disappointed because chemicals in the pool seemed to turn the Angel ring black... Well I must say that after some time the "black" disappeared and the ring is once again as beautiful as it was when I received it. I wear it all the time but not in the pool!

 Rembrandt Winged Foot Charm It's perfect.My brother was in track and I wanted to find the simplest least-feminine-looking track charm I could find to fit on a masculine silver chain for him on Christmas. I could NOT believe how difficult it was to find one- everything else had too many details or was clearly made for a female athlete.This silver charm was exactly what I was looking for. (I will add though that it is very very small but it works and you may like it for your purposes.)

 Princess jewelry For the little princess in your life. Quality craftsmanship and beautiful pieces of jewelry. I bought these for a friends one year old.

 Wrong item and not great customer service I live outside US I ordered the item to be shipped to freight forwarder address and re-send it to me. I ordered the yellow gold Y charm and got white one instead. I contactated Amazon 3 times mentioning this situation.1. The first one I explained the situation but gave them the wrong order number (my mistake). The cust. service agent asked me to contact the seller without reading through my explanatory notes.In the mean time I submitted feedback about the misleading image on yellow gold but reality was they were sending white gold instead.2. I contacted them the second time with the right order number this time. The agent asked me to send it back for a replacement. He didn't read throught my notes neither since I explained I live outside the US.3. The third contact

 Looks and feels great! I love this eyebrow ring! It's a very pretty shade of bright red and the glitter adds to the charm of it. It doesn't appear quite as "glittery" as it does here and the glitter isn't something you can see all that well from farther away but it still looks nice; you get just a hint of sparkle when you see it in the light. I actually think it would look better this way than to just have a giant glittery thing sitting just above your eye all the time.I also love the bioplast; I just recently started wearing bioplast body jewelry and I can already say that I love it and prefer it over the steel. It's much more comfortable and soft and the flexibility it gives is really great when trying to insert jewelry

 Cute These earrings are cute simple and elegant. I don't give a 5-star because I found the pole to be too short. I have lost the back of my earrings several times before even with longer pole so losing it this time is not a surprise to me. If you don't mind stocking on some extra backs or be extra careful on making sure that the back of your earrings are pushed tight against your ears then this is a great buy.

 Almost right. . . These earrings are so pretty but they are just a tad too long to sit on my ear correctly. They sit against the rim of cartilage above my earlobe holes and sit crooked.

 Such a shame! This belly ring looked very cute on the website but didn't live up to it in person. While the detail on the rose is nice it is angled downward so while the ring is in you cannot see the folds and it just looks like a regular ball. The photograph here is very deceiving and taken at a bad angle to make it look like the rose is just tilted downward. When you look at the ring head on in the correct position all you see are the green "leaves." As I stated above it then just looks like a two toned ball at the bottom of the barbel and no amount of contortion will reveal the design while it is in the piercing. I then decided to try it on upside down so that the flower would be at the top so you could at least see the detail. It looked a little strange but better than before but the rose promptly fell off. I had to krazy glue it back into position. It was a wonderful idea but terrible execution.

 Two tones - different on each cuff! This cuff looks almost exactly like it does online. They are attractive. The pair that we were shipped however did not match. One cuff had a darker gray and one had a lighter gray. The whites were the same.

 BEAUTIFUL!!! (The picture is correct - they are amethyst not blue topaz) Love them!Just what I like in a stone - clear enough to see the color vividly but the emerald cut makes lots of sparkle and it prevents you from seeing all the way through the stone - which gives the impression of looking into deep deep water - lovely.The earrings are a bit on the heavy side and hang down so they can't be seen. I used bullet clutch earring backs to prop them up so I could see the stones. (Amazon has bullet clutch backs - they make lots of earrings look better by propping them up nicely).The picture is accurate - they are amethyst not blue topaz.

 Beautiful Gold I recently purchased this necklace and I am very pleased. I got many compliments. My own mother asked to wear it for a wedding shower and she got compliments on it too. It shines best in natural sun light. You'll feel good wearing this and never grow bored of it. I anticipate putting it on before I leave the house. Part of why it shines so well is because of how clean the cuts on the little circles are (not sure what the correct term or word is). Augustina is an incredibly great company and although they are big into pearls the necklaces are for both men and women. Buy this item for yourself or give it to someone as a gift(just imagine the expression on their face when you hand it over to them). Just make sure you know the thickness and length you want.

 Beautiful Ring I am very pleased with this ring. The "ruby" is just the right size; not too big or too small. The ring has a lot of sparkle to it and it looks elegant. The silver in the ring is substantial and the setting is unique. A very pretty ring!

 Worst purchase ever! I ordered these earrings to match a starfish necklace I purchased at JC Penney. They turned out to be garbage when I got them. First the earrings aren't even the same. They don't match at all. One is bigger than the other and has the sterling silver stamp 925 on it but the other one doesn't. One looks all skinny and the other starfish is fatter. What a terrible purchase. I would have returned them but I figured there'd be issues since they tried to deliver my package and it somehow went astray. I had to call Eve's Addiction to find out what was going on. I will never order from them again.

 star earring (hold the fish) Take the title literally. Yes there nice and decent quality but not what i expected from the picture. The tips of the "starfish" don't bend to the side like a starfish looks like or as pictured. So they look like regular-old star earrings.

 Perfect Size! I have three holes on each side of my ears and many times I don't want my ears look "too busy" with all three pairs of earrings. The size of these pearls are perfect. The "button" shape of the pearls makes the earrings not so bulging and the pearls are "shiny." The lavender color on the earrings is darker and more purple than the ones shown online. (I think the lavender ones shown on the pictures are more peach than purple. Maybe it's just my poor eye sight.) The friction post is perfect because the back of the earrings stays on very well.

 ring I bought this ring as a promise ring for mii girlfriend. When I showed it to her online she went crazy for it and really really wanted it. When i presented it to her she blew her mind. This is a very pretty ring but the cut of the diamonds are scratchy and hard. For example if she was wearing the ring and rubbed on my arm it would feel like a claw running down my arm. Its still a very nice and beautiful ring but its a little too rough. I would still redommend it just wear it on a necklace or something jus dont hit or rub people with it on.

I love the true vintage quality of this ringso much if I ever do return to the position of purchasing a new 'real' ring. . .I would show them this one.

 Magnificent Ring At Any Price Bought this ring for my fiancee when arrangements for me to get a genuine family heirloom art deco ring for her fell through (long story). Saw the picture and instantly clicked on it to buy it. Beautiful. Then I saw the price and was fear-stricken. I thought "There is no way for that price this ring is going to look like anything except something that comes out of a gumball machine at the supermarket." Well let me tell you it's absolutely stunning. The setting is magnificently detailed and the enamel inlays add a very unique touch. My fiancee couldn't be happier and absolutely loves it. The seller was also very accommodating when I had to change the shipping address because I was travelling when it was scheduled to be delivered. All things considered

 Not a Fan I bought this product quite some time ago and I'm convinced that it is the spawn on Satan. I absolutely HATE getting ripped off so I guess I'm glad that it was so inexpensive but I'm still very disappointed with how terrible it was. The ends are made out of cheap plastic; I think that says it all. It took a great deal of muscle to even twist off the cap. Your hands have to be in perfect condition meaning not too dry or too wet otherwise you'd be unable to twist it off even with muscle power. Once you get it off you realize that you unintentionally destroyed the tip of your new navel ring because the plastic is so cheap that it chips with little effort. If the poor quality of the product weren't enough

 i wounden'd buy it again I don't like that product at all.1 it doesn't look good in real live because the product is very poorly made and is made out of cheap material.2 It seems like a new interesting Design but if u have a flat belly the two plastic-balls will hang facing downward of your belly.3 it's not like the other Piercings where u can choose you mm length and as expected the metal loop is way to long.4 It's easy to break it got a little crack all ready when i first screwed it open. Then if you closed it it will re-open but if u screw it so hard together that that doesn't happen it will break.5 This Design gets easy stuck on cloth etc. so it's easy to hurt u.I had belly Button Rings for 7 years and i have to say that hole Rings with a click-ball and the standard Design are the most comfortable to wear and u cant hurt your self by getting caught on your cloth and they don't fall out easy and don't break usually.The ones which have a big rounding like a sun around the belly button look good on pictures but never when you wear them. On thin people they stick out on people with more fat they kind of mash in. And they are soooooooo uncomfortable especially when you sit. And they Stick out of your T-shirt etc.The ones with the hanging jewelery look very nice but can break easy if made poorly and i would just get ones with round hanging ends so they don't rip on the towel ofter showering or cloth.So i hope i could help you

 Nice bracelet This is a nice bracelet. It's definitely unique but it looks alot more different than in the picture. The picture makes it look more full whereas when you receive the it you notice that the rose quartz beads are not woven all around the bracelet...more like branches on a tree. You have "branches" with the rose quartz beads attached to it. Overall I like the product.

 Looks great online.... I ordered the Silver Forbidden Gothic Pentacle Cross Pendant Necklace expecting what I saw online to be a perfect example of what it could be. I understand that the online pictures are alwase better than what you will get but this does not look or feel like silver. It feels more like a plastic like resin that is more commonly used in gum ball mechine. If your not looking at it closely or people are at a distance to you it looks realy nice but the moment you pick it up you think like all my friends did "gumball mechine".

 My new favorite links I do not agree with the review that these cuffs are too small for a man. I wear them with a business suit and tie regularly and feel they are the perfect length at about 3/4-inch or 2 cm. But also I am not a fan of large flashy cuff links. These are for a more conservative yet sophisticated look.

 A Perfect Gift! OK the ring was a HUGE hit! The intended recipient of the wonderful piece of jewelery my girlfriend has already named it and its name is "Magnifico". It was a nickname of Lord Medici the archduke of Milan and I have to tell you that it doesn't take a huge stretch of imagination to picture it on his hand. A wonderful ring with so many layers of visual beauty a perfect gift for a person that has your life in her gentle hands

 The Most Horrible Customer Experience I've Ever Had It only took Silver Insanity less than 48 hours to debit my bank account and send the electronic shipping information to the post office. That was about the extent of what they did regarding my order. Each email inquiry sent to them languished without response for nearly a week. It took them 3 weeks to finally say "We don't know what happened" and to issue me a refund.

 Classic I recently purchased these cufflinks as a Christmas gift for my husband. Usually pictures seem to be deceiving and I didn't know I would like it upon arrival.

 Simply Beautiful. I recently purchased this locket with a peridot stone. I cannot express how pleased I am with this purchase! Although I was reluctant to pay a premium price for a sterling and semi-precious locket the craftsmanship is marvelous and the chain by itself would cost $25.00 or more in any jewelry shop.This is truly an heirloom quality piece. Again I am so happy I went again and purchased a locket by Anatoli... it makes everything look cheap and silly by comparison.

 Looks like a million bucks and also could be improved I really enjoy this ring. The level of detail is really nice and continues all the way around the ring on both the sides and the face of the band. I've gotten a lot of comments on this ring I think in part because the vintage look of it sets it apart from other flashier cocktail rings. I think it's more believable that it could be real if I got it from my grandmother know what I mean?

If that was the only issue I gladly would have kept the earrings however as I was scanning the "appraisal certificate" I noticed some typos (which you can clearly see if you look at the picture of the certificate!).

First I paid $26 for them then when they are shipped to me with a brochure the same set of earrings are $16 would have been nice to only pay that for them since I get an ear infection because the sterling silver is not the grade they claim it to be.

 Very Pretty Ring.....however I bought this ring for myself and it is even more pretty in person then shown!However upon closer inspection there is what looks a piece of the stone is chipped off so sadly I had to return this item. But I'm sure that it was just a fluke and I will try to get another one as overall I really like the ring.

 Item arrived dirty! My jewelry cleaner arrived with dark streaks all around the sides from the cardboard box it came in. It looked like there was newpaper ink inside the box. I couldn't get it to come off so mine looks pretty nasty. The unit itself seems very cheaply made and it is very noisy when running. My jewelry was only slightly cleaner after using it. I would have returned it but the shipping would be almost as much as it cost. I will probably throw it away instead.

 Not Bad I've ordered this in 16" length but I ended up with an 18" long necklace. (Measured with a measuring tape.) I didn't get charged more for it but I had something in mind when I ordered the 16" and now it won't work. I don't know if this is a one time error or what.A regular snake chain with lobster clasp and 7 beads/balls it isn't bad for $12. It would've been better if the chain has diamond-cutting as well like the seller's other snake chain necklaces.The biggest bead is about 8mm in diameter

 3 S's First of all when the official product description says "snake chain" let me tell you that this isn't a regular snake chain. THIS IS A DIAMOND CUT SNAKE CHAIN. It still has the fluidity of a regular snake chain but it has a lot more shine.Like with most chains if you have problems with your fingers' dexterity then you'll need help with the lobster clasp of this chain. Other than that

 Stone fell out! NOT BEZEL I received this ring as a Christmas gift. It was beautiful until a stone fell out less than 2 months later. We took it to a jeweler and they said that it is NOT a bezel setting as claimed. They said that although the diamonds are great quality the stones are improperly set and all of them could fall out. We are currently trying to get Gem Affair to handle this matter!

 Very nice little locket! Locket looks very nice though I'm not sure how long the finish on it will last. The picture is deceiving if you think that the gem on the front sits smoothly on the surface as it does not. It actually sticks out in a little forward tube that you cannot see in the picture. Over all though very nice for the price!

 Italian 30 inch Cuban link chain necklace The 30 inch necklace was very delightful and of very high quality the only thing is that I wished the lobster claw was a little larger in order to make locking the clasp a little easier. I am pleased with this product. What I was not pleased about was that when I came home from work FedEx chose to leave the package partially under my door mat which I thought could have been fodder for someone to steal it.

 Great Necklace I had been looking for this type of necklace for a few months now. With a store that I won't name I had to send back a necklace I bought 3 times because they couldn't get it right. I began searching for a necklace like this but could not find it. Finally I found this necklace on Amazon and ordered it. It came way sooner than I expected (which is always a good thing) and felt like a kid on Christmas morning. I opened the package and liked what I saw. I wear it everywhere I go and I am glad that I bought this necklace. I would definitely recommend buying this necklace.

 Beautiful necklace I bought this necklace for my husband. I wasn't sure if the links were big enough and if the necklace was as bright looking as in the picture. The link size is just right - the 4 MM is just big enough to look like a man's necklace. The silver is very bright no dullness at all and very comfortable. My husband wears this necklace all the time. It's a good price for a high quality necklace. I would recommend this necklace to any woman who wants to buy a nice silver necklace for her boyfriend husband or significant other.

 Sturdy elegant silver chain The picture on this product really doesn't do it justice. The chain is sturdy has a nice weight to it and it's more elegant than boxy. The silver is very bright. If I were writing ad copy I'd say this chain was the perfect combination of masculinity and style.My husband was wanting a chain he could hang his wedding ring on while he was working and not worry about chain breaking/losing the ring. He also didn't want a chain he would have to fuss with if it didn't lay flat. We've both seen chains when a lot of wear "kinks the links". It was a tall order but the moment I saw this chain I thought it might be the one. When I received it I realized I'd made a good choice.Husband really loved it when he opened it. He wears it all the time - even showering with it on - and it's holding up perfectly.I was very very pleased with the quality of this product the price

 Not good! I ordered this necklace from this company & i came home today and checked my mail & i opened the package and there was nothing in there but plastic and popcorn foam. I better get a reply to my refund cause this is ridiculous. & i am very pissed off and unhappy about this. I cant believe a business like this sends items with nothing in them...

 Lasted for TWO Months...not so STURDY afterall This chain is lovely but apparently VERY delicate. After two months it fell away from my neck. The link that holds the clasp broke... I guess I'll be purchasing a new chain. FYI - this chain held a very tiny cross which caused no tension on the chain.I'll get a more sturdy chain. I gave it two stars...one for each month of service

 Buy This! This necklace is great. I was sceptical because of the price but it's even better than the pictures. I bought this for my wife to hang a Mother's Day pendant on. The site I got the pendant from wanted $70 for a similar necklace. Can you believe that! To say this thing is worth the money is an understatement. The only way I'd like it more was if it were free.

 New Sterling Silver Box Link Chain Necklace 1 MM Just purchased eight of the necklaces for silver & glass pendants I created in a jewelry class. Three chains are 1MM for the lighter pendants five are 1.5MM. I mistakenly purchased 16" chains first then returned them for 18". The necklaces are very high quality as noted in the other reviews. Even the finer chains feel strong and solid. I am very pleased with the purchase and the return for longer chains was easy and prompt. I will definitely buy from these people again. They're gems!

 Great product excellent service. I haven't worn necklaces in years and I bought a pendant at a flea market which needed a chain. The one I bought with the pendant broke within a week. I am an amazon junkie so naturally that's where I went to find a new one. I came across this chain and ordered one. It arrived early (the vendor graciously took it upon themselves to ship it priority mail at no extra charge) and it was perfect. I had 2 other pendants that I've been waiting to wear but haven't so I went back and ordered 2 more chains. I would highly recommend this seller and product to anyone in search of a well-priced quality necklace.

 Skeptical...then satisfied. I purchased this to accompany a pendent I purchased as gift. I didn't have high expectations after seeing the price but it was perfect. The chain doesn't feel cheaply made and shines very nicely. The length was perfect for my woman. I thought her ample bosom would have warranted a different change but this in combination with the pendent made her neckline even more beautiful. This is a perfect chain if you are purchasing a small or moderate sized pendent. Do not combine with something too big though because I doubt it will hold up under the weight.

 Disappointed in Bonita Springs FL. I give this product (5 stars) for the secure way it was shipped and the timely manor. As for the product it is the worst brand of Sterling Silver I have ever purchased. Correct me if I am wrong but Sterling Silver is not suppose to RUST!I literally threw the chain in the trash it had rusted so bad. I even tried cleaning it with a jewelry cleaner with no success! This chain is a disgrace to Sterling Silver products of any kind. I went out to a local department store and purchased a beautiful 20" Sterling Silver chain for only 10 bucks and it doesn't rust. The Gem Avenue Company is definitly not the place to purchase this chain! Shop around!Sincerely Disappointed

 18" silver necklace I like the chain except the 18" was more like a 16" you may want to buy a longer chain if you don't want the necklace close to your throat. The necklace is very thin and dainty it is probably best not to hang a heavy pendant on it. The necklace is not made for everyday wear and I'm worried it is going to break it so thin. I like the chain and will keep it for church or other special events.

 Good Value Silver Box link chain. I bought this chain at first for the length. 22". Most chains only come in 24" or shorter. This was a very good buy on my part because the chain is really attractive and sturdy enough to hold the pendant that I wanted it for. In fact the pendant looks even better now with this attractive chain. I should have bought more. The price was so reasonable. I am going to order a few more to have on hand. For myself or a gift item. Very pleased. Quick shipping too!! Thankyou Linda from New Jersey

I took a chance and ordered the Italian Box Link Chain Necklace and I was blown away by the quality of the Sterling Silver chain that I received.

 Beautiful product! I ordered this chain to hold a pendant that came with a chain to short for me. The price was great and shipping was super fast. I was amazed that it looked even better in person than in the picture since that is seldom the case. I have been wearing it 24/7 since I got it a month ago. It is comfortable does not pull my hair or get wrapped up in it when I sleep and there has been no discoloration or tarnishing at all. I highly recommend this beautiful chain!!

 Absolutely Perfect I ordered this chain as a replacement for necklace that I broke to I wore my cross on. When I went to the mall to find a box link chain no one had one. This chain makes the perfect replacement as it looks just like the original chain I had. The shipping was shorter than estimated and I just love it. And you just can't beat the price.

 Great chains for a great price These are excellent chains. My wife has a tendency to break delicate looking chains within a day or two but she is still wearing these after several weeks. These are very good quality for the money not cheap junk that turns green after a few days of use. My wife's chains are still as shiny and beautiful as the day she put them on for the first time. Unlike some of the other "sterling silver" she has bought in the past these chains are the real thing.

 Great Necklace for a Great Price! I purchased this necklace for my wife for Christmas or 2007. Not only did it arrive on time for Christmas the packaging was very stout. Just from seeing the box and the packing material I had no doubt that the necklace had arrived in tack.My wife loves the necklace! Plain and Simple. She says that it is great because it is interchangeable with a number of pendants that she has or it looks elegant by itself. I hit a home run with this great little stocking stuffer! You cannot go wrong with one of these necklaces!

 Perfect! It was about six days before Christmas and I was searching all the local malls trying to find a chain to go with the "O" pendant that my dad had gotten to give my mom for a Christmas gift. I could not find the chain I was looking for. Finally I decided to look on Amazon and at first didn't see anything I was interested in. I went back and looked on Amazon again the next day and saw a thin box chain but I didn't know what a box chain looked like and the pictures only showed but so much. So I decided to wait. The next day I went to work and one of my co-workers was wearing an "O" pendant on a thin box chain like the one I saw online. So I ran home during lunch that day and went on Amazon to buy the chain. I was so worried I wasn't going to find a chain that could be delivered to my house by Christmas. Finally

 Cute but shorter than expected Based on the length I actually expected this to be 'longer' than it was. (I've bought other necklaces that claim to be this same length that are much longer) There must be a difference in how different vendors measure their necklaces. Anyways although it's a bit shorter than I would have liked it's still a nice good quality necklace for an awesome price.

 Pretty I bought this to put a wiccan pentacle on and wear to work. It has held up very nicely with repeated use (wearing it 2-3 times a week). After many months it needed some polishing but that was expected. It occasionally will twist and my hair gets tangled in the clasp but that's not unexpected. I would buy from here again.

 Durable to a point I bought this chain to go with a St. Christopher medallion I was given. The 24" length is perfect neither too long or short. The only problem I have with this product is that after six to seven months the links break. Now I also keep it on 24/7 through showers and swimming. It stands up very well to chlorine and soap ; So I tend to think it has to be pretty durabl with what I put it through.

 Kind of disappointed This was the exact chain I was looking for to replace a cheap one that supported my grandma pendant. But it appears quite short for an 18". Feels more like a 16". Which I do not wear that length for the reason of feeling as if I'm being choked. But other than that I love the chain itself. Very sturdy and feminine and not cheap looking. Awesome price as well.

 chain I bought a chain from a kiosk in the mall that offered a lifetime guarantee. When my chain broke it seems it was the life time of the chain... not me. They would not replace the chain.

 Feminine I purchased this chain as a replacement for my husband's necklace. Sterling silver so obviously great quality. However due to the delicacy of size it gives off too much of a feminine vibe.

 Better than the picture Came in a nice small box that would be good enough to use if it was a present. The box weave is really nice and looks great. The only thing I suggest is that you measure your neck and how long you want it. I guessed a size of 18 inches and it was and looks really short when I wear it. But that was my fault.

 Nothing bad to say Chain is great; nothing wrong to say. I ordered one a bit longer than I would have needed but it is still great for when I have a low cut top.

 Match up for a pendant My wife's postponed birthday celebration is coming up and I ordered several items of jewelry one of which needed a chain for a pendant. She has skin reactions to anything less than 18Kt gold and with gold prices going crazy I decided against white gold. I searched through several silver selling sites and this one had what I was looking for at a very reasonable price. The 1MM 20" silver chain came in the other day and it has that gleam of new unburnished silver that looks so crisp. The clasp appears sturdy and easily handled by one person (if need be). So at this point

 Quality Exceeds Price I bought 3 of these just to model my handmade pendants; however they were so nice I ended up wearing them for my own personal use! Highly Recommend.

 Love it! I was hesitant to order such inexpensive chains but I'm so glad I did! They are beautiful chains and worked well with the pendants I had. I'll definately be ordering other lengths in this chain.

 worth every penny When I ordered this chain I wasn't really expecting much. I just needed a good silver chain to wear with my silver pendants. When I got it it was such a glistening beautiful chain that I wear it will all of my silver pendants. I'm planning on ordering the same chain in several lengths. It well exceeded my expectations.

 Very beautiful silver chain I love this sterling silver chain! We bought it for our 10 y.o. daughter and finding a 16-inch chain was key. The chain came in many other lenghts too. Our daughter wears it with her sterling silver cross pendant everyday! The cost was very inexpensive for the quality. And the item was shipped immediately. Thank you!
